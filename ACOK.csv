"Maester Cressen watches the terrible red comet in the sky from a tower of Dragonstone. He is worried by the comet and by the official confirmation from the Citadel that summer is ending. Maester Pylos interrupts his ruminations to inform him that Shireen and her fool, Patchface, have come to see the white raven. Cressen broke his hip two years ago and fell seriously ill last year, at which time Pylos was sent to be his eventual replacement. Cressen has been the maester at Dragonstone for twelve years, arriving with Stannis when he was made lord of the castle. Shireen has been troubled by dreams of dragons coming to eat her. Cressen tells her that the dragons are gone, but she overheard Dalla and Matrice saying that the red woman claims the comet in the sky is dragonsbreath, and Shireen thinks they are coming back to life. She asks if summer is over, and Cressen replies in the affirmative. It had been the longest summer on record, ten years, two turns, and sixteen days.
Pylos returns with the raven then leaves to get Cressen's breakfast, and Patchface starts to sing a song about shadows coming, a song he has been singing frequently in recent days that is bothering Shireen. Patchface was a boy when he came into the service of House Baratheon. Lord Steffon had been sent to the Free Cities by King Aerys II to find a bride for Rhaegar since he had no sisters to marry. The trip was a failure, but Steffon found a brilliant fool in Volantis to bring home with him. Lord Steffon never made it home; his ship, Windproud, broke up in Shipbreaker Bay as Robert and Stannis watched from Storm's End. Lord Steffon, his wife Cassana, and a hundred men died in the wreck. Patchface washed ashore on the third day apparently dead, but when a man named Jommy grabbed his ankles, he coughed water and sat up. His mind was gone, and the castellan, Ser Harbert, told Cressen it would be best to put him out of his misery, but Cressen demurred. Pylos returns and reports that Ser Davos Seaworth returned last night and has been closeted with Stannis most of the night. Cressen decides to go see Stannis and offer his counsel.
Stannis has declared himself king and called his banners. He has gathered three thousand men on Dragonstone and closed the port, forcing any ships that have come within sight of Dragonstone within the last year to remain there. Cressen meets Ser Davos on his way up. Ser Davos had been sent to meet with the great lords of the Stormlands. He met with Lord Gulian Swann, Lord Selwyn Tarth, and Lord Penrose, but none would declare for Stannis. Lord Beric Dondarrion is missing and feared dead,1 and Lord Bryce Caron is with Renly and a member of his new Rainbow Guard, a new order of knighthood commanded by Ser Loras that is like the Kingsguard except that each knight wears a different color. Cressen asks if Davos brought no hope, and the knight replies that he only could if he lied, and he would never do so to Stannis.
Cressen remembers when Davos was knighted after the siege of Storm's End. The siege had lasted almost a year and the castle was completely blockaded by land and sea by Lord Mace's army and Lord Paxter's galleys. The horses, dogs, and cats were long gone and only roots and rats remained when Davos, an infamous smuggler in those days, brought a single ship into the castle under cover of darkness bearing onions and salt fish. The food allowed the castle to hold out until Lord Eddard broke the siege. As a reward for his service, Stannis gave Davos choice lands on Cape Wrath, a small keep, and a knighthood. For his crimes as a smuggler, Stannis chopped off the last joint of the four fingers on Davos's left hand.
Cressen completes the climb and enters Stannis's presence. Stannis is gloomy and bitter at Davos's news. The fact that the Stormlords have declared for Renly exacerbates Stannis's bitterness that Robert granted Storm's End to Renly instead of him. He took Dragonstone because Robert's enemies were there, but he never wanted to be named lord of the castle when his work was done. Stannis is also fed up with his lords and captains, Lord Ardrian Celtigar, Lord Monford Velaryon, Lord Duram Bar Emmon, Lord Guncer Sunglass, and the sellsword admirals Salladhor Saan and Morosh the Myrman. Cressen says he should treat with Renly, but Stannis refuses while Renly maintains he is a king. Cressen next suggests Robb Stark, but he is just another usurper in Stannis's eyes, and a green boy at that. He is also envious of Eddard, upon whom Robert always lavished so much praise. Stannis sat on Robert's small council for fifteen years helping Lord Jon rule, and was not happy that Eddard was named Hand instead of him on Jon's death. Cressen finally suggests betrothing Shireen to Robert Arryn in return for aid from Lysa. Stannis does not like this idea because Robert is weak and sickly. Stannis says Robert was going to be a page for him, but Cersei had Jon killed before the arrangements could be finalized.2 Stannis still thinks it might be worth a try until his wife, Selyse, comes in and disdains treating with anyone for what belongs to Stannis by right. She promises that House Florent will rally to him, but Stannis is not so sure they will risk Lord Mace Tyrell's wrath, and they will still not be able to provide enough men. Selyse then tells him to embrace the Lord of Light. She says Melisandre has looked into the flames and seen Renly dead. She says the comet is a sign that Stannis must sail and the banners of the Reach and the stormlands will flock to him. Cressen dissents vigorously, stating that fratricide is not the answer, but Stannis dismisses him. Cressen returns to his chambers and resolves that he must not allow this fratricide to occur. He goes into his stores and takes some strangler crystals to use at a banquet that night. He decides to take a nap, but oversleeps.
Cressen hobbles to the great hall, where the feast has already commenced, but crashes into Patchface on his way in. Melisandre comes to help him up and warns him that there are some truths not taught in Oldtown. He is surprised to find Pylos seated in his place, and Stannis informs him that Pylos will advise from now on. Cressen takes a seat by Ser Davos, who is on the dais along with King Stannis, Queen Selyse, Pylos, Melisandre, Lord Ardrian, Lord Duram, Lord Guncer, Lord Monford, and Salladhor Saan. Ser Davos tells Cressen that Stannis has chosen to trust Melisandre's visions and press his claim. Cressen tries once more to sway Stannis and claims that R'hllor has no power in Westeros. Melisandre warns him again, and Lady Selyse makes him wear Patchface's bucket helmet as mockery. He decides he must act and places the strangler in a cup of wine and offers to share the cup with Melisandre and drink to the Lord of Light. She agrees, but as he approaches, she says it is not too late to pour out the wine. They drink. Melisandre is unaffected by the poison; Maester Cressen dies from the poison.","After Yoren pulled Arya into the alley,1 he shaved her head and informed her she would be known as Arry the orphan and pretend she is a boy. She is now on the road north with Yoren and thirty recruits for the Night's Watch culled mostly from the dungeons.2 The worst of them are three criminals that are kept in one of the wagons in chains; one of them has no nose, and another is fat and bald with pointed teeth and weeping sores on his cheeks.3 There are also wagons full of supplies for the Watch. Yoren plans to take Arya back to Winterfell on his way to the Wall. There are two orphan boys from the streets, a former dyer's apprentice and thief named Lommy Greenhands and the son of a baker nicknamed Hot Pie, who tease Arya and call her Lumpyhead. One day, Lommy and Hot Pie taunt Arya about Needle and threaten to hurt her if she does not give it to them, even after the Bull, an older and stronger boy that was given that name by the other boys because of the bull's head helmet he always carries,4 tells them to back off, so Arya attacks them with her wooden practice sword and beats Hot Pie mercilessly until Yoren breaks it up. He takes her aside and whacks her with the wooden sword three times and tells her to behave. He also tells her that a man had come to him with a boy,4 some gold, and a promise that Eddard would be joining the Watch too.5 Arya realizes that her father was supposed to live, but Joffrey killed him anyway. After the incident, the orphan boys avoid her.","Ser Arys comes to escort Sansa to the tournament that is about to begin celebrating Joffrey's name day. She asks him what he thinks about the comet, and he comments that it is a sign that Joffrey's reign will be blessed because it is appearing on his name day and is Lannister crimson. Sansa is wearing a dress with long sleeves to hide the bruises left by Ser Boros when he beat her when Joffrey learned of Robb's victories.1 Ser Arys makes Sansa feel less uncomfortable than the other Kingsguard, as he is always polite and even attempted to refuse to beat her the first time Joffrey asked him to and did not do so as hard as the others when he finally gave in. The others obeyed without question, except for Sandor whom Joffrey never asks. The tournament is being held in the Red Keep for security, and only forty or so will participate, many of them squires and freeriders. It will be a poor field. Queen Cersei will not be there because the small council is meeting. Arys confides to Sansa that Lord Tywin disobeyed a direct order from Cersei to bring his army to King's Landing, and she is furious.
There are only a few people in the crowd: Lord Gyles Rosby; Lady Tanda Stokeworth and her daughters, Falyse and Lollys; Jalabhar Xho; and Lady Ermesande Hayford, who is only a baby yet is rumored to soon be married to a Lannister so the house can gain her lands. Joffrey, Tommen, and Myrcella are seated together in a pavilion and are guarded by Sandor. Tommen is excited because he is going to ride in the tournament, though only against a straw dummy. Joffrey is in a good mood because he has just learned that Viserys is dead.2 He boasts that he will defeat Robb in single combat. Participants in the tournament include Ser Meryn, Ser Balon, Ser Horas, Ser Hobber, Ser Dontos, Morros Slynt, and a sellsword in service to Lord Petyr named Lothor Brune.
When Ser Dontos's turn to ride comes up, he is too drunk to participate. Joffrey, who has been getting angry because of the poor field in the tournament, orders him drowned in wine. Horrified, Sansa tells him not to because it will bring ill luck on his name day. She is lying and he knows it, but Sandor speaks up on her behalf and Joffrey agrees to kill him the next day. Sansa suggests making him a fool instead, and Joffrey likes the idea and decrees it will be so. Joffrey disgustedly declares the tournament to be over. Tommen insists on riding, and Joffrey reluctantly allows it. Ser Aron and some squires help outfit him, and he rides against the straw-filled dummy, which gives him a blow that knocks him off his horse. He is preparing to ride again when the portcullis suddenly rises and Tyrion rides in at the head of a group of Lannister men-at-arms, freeriders, and clansmen, including a graceful black-haired sellsword,3 an incredibly large and hairy man,4 and a youth with a missing eye.5 He approaches Joffrey and bows before him. He subtly mocks Joffrey, who leaves. Tyrion then turns to Sansa and promises he will not hurt her, and then walks off to find Cersei.","Tyrion, flanked by Bronn and Timett, is being denied access to the small council chamber by Ser Mandon. Tyrion finally blusters his way through. Cersei is meeting with Varys, Petyr, Pycelle, and Janos. Tyrion presents a letter from Lord Tywin naming Tyrion Hand of the King until such time as Tywin can assume the role himself. Cersei is angry and claims the appointment is invalid, but Tyrion points out there is little she can do about it. He asks the council members to give him some time alone with Cersei. On his way out Lord Petyr asks Tyrion if he needs quarters prepared, and Tyrion says he will stay in the Tower of the Hand. Petyr is surprised, given what happened to Jon and Eddard, the last two Hands, and Tyrion tells him that the Hand before them died in the sack of King's Landing,1 the Hand before him was burned alive,2 and the two before him died as penniless exiles.3 Lord Tywin was the last Hand to leave with his life and property intact.
When the others leave, Cersei rounds on him furiously. She threatens to name the letter a forgery and throw Tyrion in the dungeon, but Tyrion tells her that he can get Jaime back. Tyrion asks her about recent events. Joffrey had been told to pardon Eddard, but took it upon himself to give the mob a show. Lord Janos was promised Harrenhal by Petyr in return for siding with the Lannisters. Ser Barristan was dismissed because Joffrey wanted to blame someone for Robert's death, and Varys suggested Barristan.4 Tyrion asks her what the smallfolk will think if they see the legendary Barristan riding with another king, and she admits that was something she did not consider. Tyrion says this is why she needs help. She reluctantly agrees, but only if he shares all his plans with her. He agrees, though he has no intention of doing any such thing. Tyrion then asks her who murdered Lord Jon, and Cersei says she does not know.5 She does reveal that she helped Robert to his hunting accident by having Lancel keep him well supplied with wine three times as potent as Robert was used to. Tyrion takes his leave.
Timett has wandered off, and Tyrion orders Bronn to arrange quarters for the clansmen. Tyrion leaves the Red Keep with an escort of Lannister house guards under the command of the captain of the queen's guard, Vylarr. On the way out, he orders the heads of the Stark household taken down from the walls. The streets of King's Landing have grown restless. No food is getting into the city because of the war in the riverlands and Highgarden's declaration for Renly has closed the roads to the south and west. Cersei has tripled the size of the City Watch, put thousands of craftsmen to work strengthening the city's defenses, and ordered the Alchemists' Guild to produce ten thousand jars of wildfire. Lord Petyr is providing the coin to pay for all this by levying a tax on all those who would enter the city. Tyrion returns to his inn, where Shae, Chella, and a large number of Black Ears are waiting for him. He is surprised to discover that Varys is there as well. He leaves shortly, but not before he makes it clear that Tyrion will not be able to hide anything from him. Tyrion takes Shae upstairs and has sex with her. He dare not bring her to the Red Keep because his father forbade it, but he plans to find a house for her in the city. After they have made love, Shae asks what he plans to do in King's Landing, and he answers that he will do justice.","Bran lies abed listening to Summer and Shaggydog howl. He has dreamt often of wolves recently and feels he can almost understand what the two direwolves are saying. They howl all the time now. Osha says they are howling because they know what is coming. The comet has caused quite a bit of consternation. Osha says it stands for blood and fire to come, Septon Chayle thinks it is a sign of summer's end, soon confirmed by the arrival of a white raven, and Old Nan, who cannot see very well but claims she can smell the comet, says it means dragons are coming. The direwolves have been locked in the godswood since Shaggydog bit Little Walder. Bran decides to howl with them, bringing a guard, Hayhead, in to see what is going on. Bran keeps howling, and Hayhead brings Maester Luwin, who tells him to sleep. Bran describes the dreams he has. Sometimes, he dreams of a great weirwood. Other times he dreams he is a wolf. He is frustrated because he is not allowed to send Big Walder and Little Walder away and because he tried to ride out of the castle on Dancer but Alebelly would not let him out the gate since it is too dangerous. He keeps howling, and Maester Luwin leaves.
Bran thinks about the Walders. Big Walder is actually smaller than Little Walder, but is the older of the two by fifty-two days, which is how he got the name. They explain that there are many other Walders as well, including Black Walder, fourth in the Frey succession, Red Walder, and Walder Rivers. There are also several girls named Walda and a Waltyr Frey as well. He does not like the Walders because they insist on playing a game called lord of the crossing that he cannot play because he is lame. The game has attracted many of the children of the castle, such as the cook's boy Turnip,1 Joseth's girls Bandy and Shyra, the kennel girl Palla, Cayn's son Calon, and Fat Tom's son TomToo. One day, Rickon came to play too, but after Little Walder whacked him with a stick as part of the game, Shaggydog attacked him. Ironically, Rickon became good friends with them after that. Maester Luwin returns with Osha and a sleeping potion. Right before Bran falls asleep, Osha tells him that he should not fight the wolf dreams, as the gods may be trying to talk to him. When he falls asleep, he dreams that he is Summer in the godswood and thinks that he must escape into the wider world or die.2","Yoren's party1 continues north. As they travel, they encounter more and more refugees on the kingsroad fleeing south and begin to see graves by the road. One of the men in the party, a sellsword named Praed, succumbs to illness. Yoren gives his longsword to the Bull. The next night, they stop at an inn to eat and wash. The innkeeper gives them a free round of beer because his brother, Lync, took the black several years ago after filching pepper from the table of a Ser Malcolm. Yoren even sends Lommy with beer for the three locked in the wagon. The patrons, including a man named Hod, warn Yoren against going north, where it is all burnt fields and raiders. There are also rumors of a large pack of wolves near the Gods Eye led by a particularly large she-wolf. Arya thinks it might be Nymeria. One patron claims the big wolf stalked right into a town and ate a baby. Arya protests that a wolf would not do that, and Yoren sends her to the stables to check on the horses.
Jaqen H'ghar, one of the three convicts chained in the wagon, hails Arya as she enters the stables and asks her to get him more beer. He introduces his companions, Rorge and Biter. They are rude to her and threaten her, so Arya stalks closer and hits Biter with her practice sword right between the eyes. The Bull comes in and takes her back outside. She challenges the Bull to a fight, but just when they are about to begin, the Bull notices some gold cloaks approaching, and they hide. Their leader hands Yoren an order from the queen telling him to turn over one of his boys. Yoren refuses. The gold cloak threatens him, and several of the others, Tarber, Cutjack, Kurz, Koss, Reysen, Dobber, and even Hot Pie, come to Yoren's aid. Arya thinks they are there for her, and she steps out with Needle in hand. The Bull steps out behind her, and the gold cloak says he is the one they want. Yoren puts his sword at the officer's throat, forces him to drop his own, and tells him to leave. The officer says he will be back. Yoren asks who wants the discarded sword, and Hot Pie speaks up and gets it. The Bull asks why they would want Arya, and she retorts that there is no reason they should want him either.2 She asks his name, and he tells her it is Gendry. Yoren says they must leave immediately, as the gold cloaks will be back. He tells Gendry and Arya that if the group is overtaken, they are to run and make for the Wall.","Jon goes down into the vaults of Castle Black looking for Sam, whom Lord Commander Mormont had sent down there to find maps for the expedition into the far north. He finds Sam immersed in the collection of the Night's Watch, which contains thousands of volumes. Sam wishes he had time to organize the collection and study it, but Jon is indifferent to the history. Sam particularly points out an account written by a ranger named Redwyn during the reign of King Dorren Stark in which he traveled to Lorn Point on the Frozen Shore, fought giants, and traded with the children of the forest. Lord Commander Mormont is taking two hundred men on the expedition, three-quarters of them rangers, to be joined by one hundred men from the Shadow Tower led by Qhorin Halfhand. Sam is coming along to manage the ravens since Maester Aemon is far too frail to join the expedition.
They return to the surface with the maps and are joined by Ghost. They watch Ser Endrew drill a group of new recruits brought in by Conwy, a beggar,1 a brigand, a barber, two orphans,2 and a boy whore,3 none of whom are particularly suited to the job. Donal Noye tells Jon that they came from a dungeon near Gulltown. Jon and Sam continue on to Lord Commander Mormont's chambers, where Thoren Smallwood, the new acting first ranger, is arguing with the Lord Commander that the command should go to him and Mormont should remain at Castle Black. Lord Commander Mormont flatly refuses and dismisses him. On his way out, he shoots Jon and Sam a hard look, as he was a confidant of Ser Alliser. When Mormont turns his attention to Sam, he becomes so frightened he can barely speak. After Sam leaves, the Lord Commander states he was considering sending Sam to treat with Renly, but feels that a quaking fat boy will not make the right impression. He plans to send Ser Arnell instead, whose mother was a green-apple Fossoway.
Lord Commander Mormont tells Jon the history behind Maester Aemon's decision to come to the Wall and how he could have been a king. Aemon's grandfather was King Daeron II, the king who brought Dorne into the realm and married a Dornish princess.4 His father was King Maekar I, fourth son of Daeron. He was Maekar's third son and was named for Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, whom some said was Daeron's true father rather than King Aegon IV the Unworthy. Aemon was no good with a sword but had quick wits, so Daeron sent him to the Citadel at nine or ten. Aemon's uncle, the heir to the throne, was killed in a tourney mishap while he was away.5 His sons6 died soon after in the Great Spring Sickness. Daeron II died as well, and his second son, Aerys I took the throne. Aerys wed his sister7 and ruled for about a decade, in which time Aemon became the maester for a minor lord. Aerys died without issue, and Maekar became king. He summoned Aemon to court and wanted to make him an adviser, but Aemon did not want to usurp the role of the Grand Maester, so he served his eldest brother Daeron instead. Daeron died of a pox contracted from a whore, while Aemon's other elder brother Aerion, known as ""the Monstrous"", died drinking wildfire, which he believed would turn him into a dragon. About a year later, Maekar died in battle against an outlaw lord. A Great Council was called to determine who should now take the throne. Both Daeron's daughter and Aerion's infant son were passed over, as the daughter was a feeble-witted female and no one wanted someone with Aerion's blood on the throne. Aemon was secretly offered the crown, but he declined. Rule therefore fell to his younger brother Aegon V, thereafter known as ""the Unlikely"" because he became a king despite being the fourth son of a fourth son. Aemon knew that if he remained at court he could become a tool of those who might oppose his brother's reign, so he voluntarily joined the Night's Watch. Jon wonders at first why Mormont has told him all this until he realizes it is to test Jon's resolve to keep his vows now that Robb is a king. Jon promises that he will keep those vows.","Ser Robin Ryger brings Ser Cleos Frey before Robb, who is attended by Catelyn, Theon, Edmure, the Greatjon, Olyvar, and Grey Wind. He is wearing his new crown, based on the original crown of the King in the North lost to Aegon the Conqueror, a bronze circlet incised with the runes of the First Men and surmounted by nine black spikes in the shape of longswords. Robb orders Ser Cleos to carry a message to Cersei and then return to his captivity. The message is an offer of peace. Lord Rickard leaves the hall in disgust when this is announced. The terms are as follows: Sansa and Arya must be released, after which Robb will release Willem and Tion; Sansa's betrothal to Joffrey is to end; Eddard's bones and those of his household must be returned, as must Ice; Lord Tywin must release his captives from the Green Fork, after which Robb will release his captives save Jaime, who will remain a hostage; and Joffrey must renounce all claim to the north and the riverlands. Maester Vyman has drawn a map denoting the borders of the new kingdom. The agreement is to be secured by ten highborn hostages, two of which Robb will release each year of peace.
Catelyn, Edmure, and Robb confer afterwards. Catelyn is worried about Lord Rickard, and Edmure states that losing him would be disastrous. Catelyn wanted better terms, but had a hard time convincing Robb to make any offer at all; she is desperate to get her girls back. Edmure thinks they should march on Harrenhal, but Robb does not have the strength and his host gets smaller by the day because Edmure gave leave to the river lords to return to their lands. Ser Marq, Lord Karyl, and Lord Jonos have already left, and Lord Jason has stated his intent to do the same. Catelyn continues to badger Robb about the girls, angering him. He asks if she will not go back to the Twins or Winterfell, but she says she must stay while her father lives. Robb is sending Theon to Pyke to treat with Lord Balon Greyjoy, for his longships will be necessary for the continued prosecution of the war.
Catelyn goes to see her father and finds Ser Brynden with him, just returned from a scouting mission. Catelyn tells him that Hoster sleeps most of the time now, gets weaker every day, and rarely makes sense anymore when he speaks. Catelyn is happy, however, that Brynden has made peace with him. Catelyn and Ser Brynden go outside and discuss the comet. The Greatjon thinks the old gods sent it as a message of vengeance, Edmure thinks it is Tully red and heralds victory, and Catelyn fears it is Lannister crimson and spells defeat. Brynden thinks it heralds blood. Brynden reports that the fighting goes badly in the riverlands. Ser Marq and Lord Karyl have won minor victories and Lord Beric continues to raid the Lannister rear. Ser Burton Crakehall claimed to have killed him, but then fell into an ambush orchestrated by Lord Beric and died.1 Elsewhere, the lords of the riverlands are faring less well. Lord Jonos was repulsed from Stone Hedge and wounded; his nephew Hendry was slain. Lord Tytos retook Raventree, but the land around it is a scorched desert. Lyman's men retook the Darry keep, but Gregor descended on them a fortnight later and put the whole garrison to the sword, including Lyman. Gregor, Ser Amory, and Vargo Hoat are pillaging everything, leaving only ruin in their wake. Worse, Ser Stafford and Ser Daven Lannister are gathering another army at Casterly Rock, though this army will consist of sellswords, freeriders, and green boys and will take time to put into the field. Lord Tywin obviously wants Robb to march on Harrenhal, which would be foolish, as it is one of the mightiest castles in Westeros. King Harren the Black built it three hundred years ago, but when Aegon the Conqueror arrived, he merely burned the castle, killing Harren and his family. The castle has been reputed to be cursed ever since, and misfortune seems to haunt its owners. Catelyn decides that they must force Tywin to come out, and the only way to do that is to convince Renly to come north.","Tyrion shares wine with Lord Janos, whom he has gotten quite drunk. Lord Janos had given Tyrion a list of six men to replace him as head of the City Watch and now tells Tyrion that Allar Deem would be the best man for the job. Tyrion says he was considering Ser Jacelyn Bywater, the commander of the Mud Gate for the last three years who was knighted for valor by King Robert during Greyjoy's Rebellion. He is not on the list because Janos thinks him too rigid and honorable and because he is a cripple who lost a hand at Pyke, the reason for his knighthood. Tyrion points out that Allar is not well liked and asks about an incident in a brothel. Apparently, Allar was sent to kill a baby1 at a brothel and ended up killing the mother too when she resisted. Tyrion asks who gave the order, but Janos will not tell. Tyrion next turns to the subject of Eddard and how he ended up being executed, and Janos says he had to obey the king. Tyrion insults him and tells him that his eldest son2 will be Lord Slynt now and will be given lands some place on which to build a keep, with Harrenhal going to someone else. His other two sons3 will be fostered out as squires. Tyrion then informs Janos that he will be sailing on the Summer's Dream in the morning, bound for Eastwatch and the Night's Watch. Janos walks out defiantly, only to be confronted by Ser Jacelyn, the new Commander of the City Watch. Ser Jacelyn has Lord Janos escorted away, and Tyrion gives him the list containing the names of the six people Janos recommended to replace him as Commander and tells Jacelyn to ship them north too. He says that Allar should be lost at sea.4
Varys enters; he and Tyrion had planned this together, and Ser Jacelyn was Varys' recommendation for the new City Watch Commander. Tyrion rounds on Varys angrily for not telling him that Cersei ordered the baby killed, as she is the only logical person that would have done so. She did it because the baby1 was Robert's. He is also annoyed that Varys did not prevent it, and Varys says that he got another boy out of the city.5 Varys mentions that the girl's mother still dearly loved Robert, but Tyrion thinks of Tysha and Shae and wonders if a whore can truly love anyone. He has set Shae up in a manse, but she is restive. She says she wants to see him more, but she seems more interested in being at court.
Varys and Tyrion go over other tidbits that Varys has learned. The captain of the White Hart plans to defect to Stannis, and Ser Horas and Ser Hobber have bribed a guard to get them out of the castle and then set sail on a Pentoshi ship called Moonrunner. The City Watch will deal with them both. Timett killed the son of a wineseller just that evening for cheating as well. There are also many prophets in the streets preaching about the comet. Finally, Ser Balon made a joke about the proliferation of kings at a dinner party held by Lady Tanda, but Tyrion is not interested in punishing treasonable table talk. After Varys leaves, Tyrion ponders how Cersei will respond to his actions, but he is confident that he is well protected now that he controls the City Watch along with his clansmen and a growing force of sellswords Bronn is recruiting. Bronn himself arrives and reports on his recruiting. He questions each candidate to learn where they fought and how well they lie and then has a sparring match with them. Still feeling disgusted by the murder of Robert's bastard, Tyrion asks Bronn if he would kill a baby without question. Bronn replies that he would not; he would ask how much first.","Yoren has taken the party1 off the kingsroad and onto poor trails in order to avoid any more pursuit. Lommy and many of the other boys treat Gendry like someone special since the queen wants him, but he is uncomfortable with the attention. They are largely out of provisions and mostly live off what Koss and Kurz, who were poachers before being caught, can hunt. At a holdfast called Briarwhite, they take some corn, but are chased off from restocking by farmers armed with scythes, much to Yoren's disgust. Arya is able to catch a rabbit one day that everyone shares, including Biter, Rorge, and Jaqen. Rorge mocks her, but Jaqen thanks her politely for the treat. The going is slow, and once they have to detour for two days to avoid a group of soldiers flying a brown banner bearing a spotted treecat.2 After several more days of travel, Dobber spots a large fire in the distance.
The next day, the group comes upon a burned out holdfast. Yoren investigates with Murch and Cutjack and brings back the only two survivors, a woman with a missing arm and a little girl.3 Rorge and Biter find their wretched state funny until Murch shuts them up. Hot Pie tells Arya he is scared and apologizes for threatening her earlier. The woman dies that night. The water from the river tastes funny, and Lommy says it is because of corpses upstream, causing Hot Pie to attack him until Reysen pulls them apart. Arya drinks too much of the water and has to leave the camp to go to the bathroom, where she encounters a pack of wolves who just look at her and walk away. She tells Yoren about the wolves and how she wished she were home. Yoren says he has been a recruiter for thirty years, always taking the kingsroad and never considering an alternate route. He concedes that this time they probably should have taken a ship.","Davos watches the Seven burn with his sons Allard and Dale. Melisandre says a prayer while walking around the fire as Stannis and Selyse look on. The queen's men had destroyed the sept. Ser Hubard Rambton and his sons tried to defend it, but he was slain along with one son and the others were thrown in prison along with Septon Barre. Lord Guncer then told Stannis he could no longer support him, and he was thrown in prison too. Lords Ardrian, Duram, and Monford are there, but seem uncomfortable. Davos is also uncomfortable, but owes Stannis everything. It is thanks to Stannis that Davos has a knighthood, that his sons Dale and Allard command the galleys Wraith and Lady Marya, that his son Maric is oarmaster on Fury, and that his son Matthos serves Davos on his galley, Black Betha. His son Devan is squire to Stannis, his wife Marya is mistress of a keep, and his two youngest sons1 will hopefully be knighted someday. In return for all these favors, Davos's loyalty is unwavering.
Melisandre proclaims that it is written that at the end of a long summer when the stars bleed and darkness covers the land Azor Ahai shall be reborn and draw Lightbringer, a flaming sword, from the fire and destroy the darkness. She bids Stannis to come forth. His squires, Devan and Bryen Farring, prepare him as Patchface sings of flames under the sea. Stannis reaches into the flames and pulls out a sword that had been thrust into the Mother; the sword glows with a green flame. Selyse, Ser Axell Florent, and other queen's men shout in adulation, and Melisandre declares Stannis to be Azor Ahai reborn. Stannis has to drop the sword afterwards and soon departs. Davos notices that the sword is a charred ruin. After the ceremony is over, Davos goes down to the port, which is crowded with the ships of Stannis's fleet, including the flagship, Fury, Lord Steffon, Stag of the Sea, Lord Monford's Pride of Driftmark, Lord Ardrian's Red Claw, and Swordfish. Further out in the harbor is Salladhor Saan's flagship, Valyrian. Davos turns aside and enters an inn.
Inside, Davos spies Salladhor Saan and joins him. They have been friends a long time, and it was Davos who traveled to Lys on behalf of Stannis to recruit the banker, smuggler, and pirate who styles himself the Prince of the Narrow Sea. One of Salladhor's trading ships, Bird of a Thousand Colors, is just arrived with news. He says that Tyrion is in King's Landing and has run out Janos Slynt. The city is not well defended as there are too few men. Renly has left Highgarden and marches on King's Landing. Salladhor does not believe that the sword Stannis pulled out of the fire was Lightbringer and is grateful for it. He tells the story of the forging of the original sword. According to legend, Azor Ahai forged Lightbringer when a great darkness was upon the land. He spent thirty days and thirty nights in a temple forging the blade in sacred fires, but when he tempered it in water, the sword shattered. The next forging took fifty days and nights and Azor Ahai tempered it by plunging the blade into the heart of a lion, but once again he failed. For the third attempt, Azor Ahai worked the forge for a hundred days and nights and then summoned his wife, Nissa Nissa, to plunge the blade into her breast. By sacrificing the thing he loved most in the world, Azor Ahai was able to complete Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes. Salladhor takes his leave, and Davos departs soon after.
That evening, Devan comes with a summons from Stannis. On his way to see the king, he is stopped by Ser Axell. Axell served as castellan of Dragonstone for ten years while Stannis served on the small council, but has lately become one of the foremost of the queen's men who are fanatically devoted to the Lord of Light. He is particularly fervent this night and claims that he saw a vision in the flames, as the priests of the Lord of Light are supposed to be able to from time to time. Stannis is attended by Maester Pylos when Davos arrives. Stannis shows Davos a letter, but Davos cannot read, though his youngest sons Daven, Stannis, and Steffon can. Pylos reads the letter for him, which declares Joffrey, Tommen, and Myrcella the children of Jaime and sets forth Stannis's claim to the throne. The letter is executed in the name of the Lord of Light. Stannis plans to use all 117 ravens on Dragonstone to send the message to every corner of the realm. He means to have Davos and Dale sail their ships in opposite directions around the coast of the realm and announce the same message. Allard will sail to the Free Cities and do the same. Davos indicates that he would like a private word, and Stannis sends Pylos away.
Davos is curious what Stannis's lords made of the letter, and he says they all flattered him and that he wants the truth from Davos. Davos points out that there is still no proof of incest, and Stannis says that Storm's End holds a proof of a sort, Edric Storm, whom Robert acknowledged as his bastard because the child's mother was Delena Florent and she had been a maiden before they had conceived the child on Stannis's wedding night in Stannis's marriage bed. Stannis wants to parade Edric, who is the very image of Robert, before the realm and point out how none of the royal children have Robert's features, but Davos points out that getting him out of Storm's End would be difficult. Davos also says that the people will not like him replacing their gods with a new one. Stannis is indifferent. He does not believe in gods and has not since he watched his parents die, but he cannot deny Melisandre's power. He tells of a falcon he owned in his youth that he found injured and nursed back to health. He named the bird Proudwing and was fond of it, but it would never hunt. Robert, on the other hand, had a great bird called Thunderclap that never missed a strike. Finally, Stannis's great uncle, Ser Harbert, told him to choose a new bird because he was embarrassing himself. Stannis saw the wisdom and did so. Of the four kings in Westeros, he is the weakest in military strength, and so he hopes that Melisandre can tip the balance.","Theon watches the castle of Pyke get closer on board the Myraham. There is no safe anchorage there, so the ship sails around the island of Pyke to Lordsport. Theon sees a large number of longships there bearing sigils of important houses such as the blood moon of House Wynch, the black warhorn of House Goodbrother, and the silver scythe of House Harlaw, and realizes that his father has called the banners. He is puzzled at first, but decides it must be a defensive move as his father and his uncle Victarion, commander of the Iron Fleet, are both old men and have no doubt grown cautious. He also spies Lord Balon's personal longship, Great Kraken, but notes that his uncle Euron's ship, Silence, is not in port. He has been sleeping with the captain's daughter during the trip, and she begs him to take her as his salt wife, but he refuses. Theon wonders who will meet him at the pier, thinking it might be Lord Sawane Botley, the steward Sylas Sourmouth, or Dagmer Cleftjaw. Robb sent ahead ravens announcing his coming, and when he and Lord Jason reached Seagard and found no longship waiting, Jason sent his own birds as well. At first he thinks no one is there, but then a priest of the Drowned God speaks up. Theon does not recognize him at first, but then vaguely remembers that Balon said in one of his letters that his younger brother Aeron had gone down in a storm and then turned to religion when he washed up on shore. Theon expresses surprise that Dagmer was not sent with an honor guard, and Aeron replies that he has gone to Old Wyk to bring the longships of Stonehouse and Drumm because they have been called to war. After blessing Theon in the name of the Drowned God, Aeron leads him on the road to Pyke.
On the way to Pyke, Theon tries to engage his uncle in conversation, but the man is grim and terse, quite different from when Theon left ten years ago when his uncle was fond of songs, ale, and women. He asks if his sister and mother are at Pyke, and Aeron informs him that Asha has taken her longship, Black Wind, to Great Wyk and his mother1 is troubled by illness and has gone to Harlaw to be with her sister.2 Theon also tries to learn what his father's plans are, but Aeron will not say. Theon is furious and says that he is Balon's heir and should be told, but Aeron indicates that his sister may succeed Lord Balon instead of him, as he is now seen as an outsider and a Stark. Theon laments that the old lords continue to fight the old battles and that Lord Jason had been the same way on the road to Seagard, showing disapproval that Patrek was taking a liking to Theon because House Mallister had suffered numerous raids from the ironborn. Patrek pointed out that only one raid had been launched against Seagard in three hundred years, when Theon's brother Rodrik attacked during Greyjoy's rebellion and was killed by Lord Jason. Theon tells Aeron that with Robb Lord of Winterfell a new day of glory for their people is at hand and points to the comet as a messenger of victory. Aeron agrees the comet is a sign, but states it is a flaming brand heralding a return to the old ways and greatness.
Aeron brings Theon to Pyke and then departs. Theon is greeted by Helya. He asks where Sylas is and Helya states that he died five years ago. He then asks after Maester Qalen and learns that he too is dead and Maester Wendamyr now looks after the ravens. She leads him to his quarters in the Bloody Keep. Theon is disquieted because his chambers are those that gave the Bloody Keep its name, where one thousand years ago the sons of the River King were hacked to pieces. The room has not been opened in years and is damp and musty. He sends Helya away for hot water and new rushes. After washing and changing, he goes to see his father. His father is disgusted with Theon's silks and velvets and his golden chain which was bought with gold and not iron and is also disdainful that Theon comes as a meek messenger. Theon counters that the plan was his idea and Robb has come to look on him as a brother, prompting an angry response from Balon to remember his real brothers, Rodrik slain at Seagard and Maron killed in the final assault on Pyke. Theon produces Robb's message, which states that if Balon will attack the Lannisters, Robb will make him King of the Iron Islands. Theon is proud of the plan, which he helped draft. It calls for Robb to march on the Golden Tooth and draw out Ser Stafford Lannister, after which the ironmen will attack from the sea and take Casterly Rock, which Theon would then want as his seat. Balon thinks Casterly Rock too strong and does not want to be given a crown. He has called his banners to take a crown, and he will not do so by marching on the Lannisters. He will move on the north.","Daenerys decides to follow her comet wherever it may take her, though it leads her people through the barren red lands. Food is scarce and water scarcer, and men and horses begin dying daily, including Doreah. One day, she decides on names for her dragons, derived from those she has lost. Her green dragon is named Rhaegal, her cream-and-gold colored dragon is Viserion, and her black dragon is Drogon. They begin growing after she realizes they will only eat cooked meat. They finally come across a city. Though it is abandoned and ruined, there is water and fig trees. Irri and Jhiqui are scared there will be ghosts, but Daenerys decides they need to rest there and recover strength.
After they are settled in, Daenerys asks Ser Jorah about his wife, and he tells his story. Lynesse Hightower was his second wife, youngest daughter of Lord Leyton Hightower and grandniece of Lord Commander Ser Gerold Hightower of the Kingsguard. His first wife had been of House Glover, but in ten years of marriage that were more dutiful than passionate; she miscarried three times and died not long after the third. By the time his wife died, he was lord of Bear Island, as his father, Jeor, had joined the Night's Watch, but before he could remarry, Balon Greyjoy declared himself a king. In the final assault on Pyke, Jorah was one of the first through the breach made in the castle wall, and he was knighted for valor. After the victory, a great tournament was held at Lannisport in celebration. Lynesse was there to see her brothers joust, and Jorah immediately fell for the maiden half his age. Jorah begged for and was granted her favor, and despite being an indifferent tourney rider, he overcame a string of formidable opponents culminating with a draw against Jaime Lannister after which Robert named him the victor. He crowned Lynesse queen of love and beauty and somewhat surprisingly gained Lord Leyton's consent to wed her. For a fortnight they were happy, but then they returned to Bear Island, which was a simple place without any of the luxuries Lynesse was used to. Jorah went into debt acquiring a cook, a harper, jewels, and clothes, and built a ship so they could sail to Lannisport and Oldtown for festivals and fairs, but she was never happy and the money finally ran out. This is why he sold poachers into slavery and then fled to Lys with Lynesse rather than face Lord Eddard's judgment. She left him after half a year and while he became a sellsword she moved into the manse of a merchant prince named Tregar Ormollen, where she is now his chief concubine. Jorah ends by saying Lynesse looked like Daenerys, and she realizes Ser Jorah wants her as a woman.
Daenerys's people name the city Vaes Tolorro, the city of bones. She sends Aggo, Jhogo, and Rakharo in different directions to find civilization. Aggo and Rakharo return empty-handed, but Jhogo, who was following the path of the comet, discovers the city of Qarth and returns with three who would see dragons; the warlock Pyat Pree, Xaro Xhoan Daxos of the Thirteen and Quaithe of the Shadow.","Lord Commander Mormont, Jon, and Thoren examine burned human remains in the village of Whitetree. The village is deserted. Mormont sends Giant up into the trees to look around and sends other brothers through the houses. Jon is paired with Dolorous Edd. This is the fourth deserted village the Watch has passed through. Chett has the dogs looking too. Mormont, Thoren, Jarmen Buckwell, and Ser Mallador Locke confer, but cannot imagine what might have happened. Giant pokes his head through the trees and reports that he cannot see anything. The Lord Commander writes a message and gives it to Jon before ordering the party to resume the march. First comes Jarmen and his scouts, followed by the vanguard under Thoren, Mormont with the main force, Ser Mallador with the baggage train, and Ser Ottyn Wythers with the rear guard. Jon brings the message to Sam to send back to Castle Black. Sam says he is hardly scared at all, much to his surprise, and Jon teases that they should make him an outrider with Grenn. Ghost joins him as he rides back to Mormont's side. The wolf always goes off hunting well away from the party, but he has not had luck finding game. Dywen has reported that the woods themselves are deserted and the game must have been frightened away by something. When Jon rejoins the Lord Commander, Mormont tries to reassure him that they will find whatever enemy awaits, but Jon just hopes the enemy does not find them first.","Yoren and company1 reach a river, but cannot find a crossing, so Yoren decides to go north and hire a boat at a nearby town to cross to Harrentown. When they arrive at the town, they find it deserted. Yoren splits everyone into groups to search the town. Arya is placed with Woth, Gendry, Hot Pie, and Lommy. There are no boats to be found. Gendry suggests building rafts, and Yoren decides to sleep on it. They make camp in the holdfast and bar the gates. Yoren sends Tarber, Kurz, and Cutjack to the top of the towerhouse to stand watch while the others settle down.
After dinner, Arya goes to sleep. She is awakened by a wolf's howl and then hears Kurz's hunting horn signaling people coming. Everyone goes to the walls and sees a column of riders setting fire to the town. Ser Amory Lorch rides up and demands that Yoren open the gates. Reysen gives a sarcastic response, and Yoren states he is of the Night's Watch and has no part in the war, but Ser Amory is not satisfied. When Yoren continues to refuse, Ser Amory declares him a rebel. A spear is hurled at Yoren, but it hits Woth instead, killing him. Ser Amory orders his men to storm the walls and kill everybody.
Yoren orders the group to draw their blades and sends Koss and Urreg to defend the postern gate. Arya engages several men and forces them off the wall. She sees Dobber and Qyle go down. Gendry makes his way over to where she and Hot Pie are. Gendry and Arya leave the wall to engage men that have broken through elsewhere, and Yoren tells her to round up all the people she can and get out through a tunnel under the barn that emerges by the lake. They call Hot Pie down and find Lommy, who is wounded in the calf. They also find Gerren, who is near death and cannot be moved, and the little girl they had previously rescued.2 When they get to the barn, it is on fire. Biter is desperately heaving himself against his chains. Jaqen sees her and asks for help. Arya goes back outside to get an axe. She sees Koss yield and get killed anyway. Back inside she crawls to the wagon and throws the axe inside. Rorge picks it up and starts hacking through the chains. Arya makes it into the tunnel, but it collapses behind her.","Pycelle presents to the small council a copy of Stannis's letter proclaiming Joffrey a bastard. Cersei wants to burn all the letters and rip out the tongues of any heard repeating the words, but Tyrion counsels letting it pass as harmless. Lord Petyr goes one step further and says they should promulgate their own tale about Stannis's daughter Shireen, saying that Lady Selyse conceived her with Patchface. Cersei is delighted by this plan. The rumor will be spread by Lord Petyr through the brothels he owns and through Varys. Mention of Varys makes Cersei wonder why he is not at the meeting. Tyrion takes his leave, saying he must check on a chain he is making for Joffrey. Bronn waits for him outside the council chamber to escort him back to the Tower of the Hand, where several master smiths await. Podrick attends Tyrion in his chambers and dresses him for the meeting. He greets the armorers, including Ironbelly and Salloreon, in his audience chamber and orders them to construct a giant chain. They are reluctant at first, seeing the work as common and also fearing Cersei's wrath because she has ordered them to make arms and armor and threatened to crush the hands of any smith that failed to meet his quota, but Tyrion promises no hands will be crushed and that any man who refuses to make links for the chain will be arrested. With the audience done, he makes preparations to go into the city.
As Tyrion rides through the streets in his litter, he is subjected to many hateful stares. Though he has ordered several carpenters to construct fishing boats, opened the kingswood to hunting, and sent gold cloaks foraging, there is still not enough food, and he receives the blame for it. They arrive at his destination, the brothel owned by Chataya. Chataya greets him and shows him some of her girls. Tyrion chooses Alayaya, who leads him to a room. Within the room is a wardrobe with a secret passage. Tyrion climbs down a ladder and is greeted by Varys, disguised by scars and stubble. Tyrion expresses his surprise that a brothel would have a secret passage, and Varys replies that it was made for another Hand of the King whose honor would not allow him to enter a brothel openly. The passage ends at a stable, where Varys provides an old horse and a cloak as a disguise so Tyrion can ride to Shae's manse undetected. They discuss Stannis and his proclamation. Tyrion wonders how Stannis knew the truth about Cersei's children, and Varys is mysterious about the topic. Tyrion tells Varys that he sometimes feels the eunuch is his best friend in the city and other times his worst enemy. Varys says he feels the same way about Tyrion.","Hodor helps Bran dress for a meeting with Lord Wyman Manderly, who has come to Winterfell for the harvest feast. They pass the practice yard on the way to the Great Hall and see Big Walder and Little Walder joust with each other. When the two Freys see Bran, they mock Hodor until Maester Luwin comes to put an end to it. Bran arrives at the hall, where Ser Rodrik and Lord Wyman have already begun eating. Lord Wyman suggests establishing a mint at White Harbor and building a fleet. Ser Rodrik says he will pass those suggestions on to Robb. The talk goes through midday, and Maester Luwin has Poxy Tym bring lunch. Lord Wyman brings up Lord Halys Hornwood's widow, Donella. She was born a Manderly, and Lord Wyman suggests that she become one again by marrying him or his son Wendel. He also mentions that Lord Tywin has sent him a letter offering to return Wyman's captive son Wylis if Wyman will sit out the war. Lord Wyman does not plan to accept the offer.
Lady Donella arrives at Winterfell that night and meets with Bran, Maester Luwin, and Ser Rodrik the next day. She states that the Bastard of Bolton1 is massing men at the Dreadfort and may be coveting her lands. She says he is a horrid man and that he and his servant Reek engage in shocking acts of debauchery. After she leaves, the three men discuss what to do. There is no heir.2 The Tallharts, Flints, and Karstarks all have ties to House Hornwood through the female line and the Glovers are fostering Lord Halys's bastard3 at Deepwood Motte. With the meeting over, Bran has Hodor carry him to the godswood. Summer greets him when he arrives, but Shaggydog slinks away. Osha is there too, swimming in one of the pools. She asks Bran if he has had more wolf dreams. He denies it, but she knows he is lying.
That night, Bran dreams of the three-eyed crow and is awakened by the arrival of Mors and Hother Umber. Mors wants leave to marry Lady Donella, and Hother wants ships to defend against wildling raiders crossing over the Bay of Seals. Ser Rodrik orders the Umbers to work with Lord Wyman to build the needed ships. The Glovers and Tallharts arrive next. Lady Sybelle is holding Deepwood Motte for her brother-in-law Galbart and her husband Robett, but she sends her steward to Winterfell. The Tallharts are represented by Ser Helman's brother Leobald, who reports that Helman's son Benfred has raised a company of teenage lancers who call themselves the Wild Hares and gallop around singing songs of chivalry. Ser Rodrik is not pleased and tells Leobald to make sure Benfred stays at Torrhen's Square. Leobald also speaks of Lady Donella and suggests sending his younger son, Beren, to foster with her. His wife4 is sister to Lord Halys, and he suggests that Beren might take the Hornwood name if he were named heir. Other houses send their regrets. The Boltons decline to come, and the Mormonts and Karstarks all went south and have no representative to send, while Lord Ondrew Locke is too frail to make the journey and Lady Lyessa Flint is pregnant and cannot travel. Howland Reed has not journeyed from his home in many years. The last to arrive is Lord Medger Cerwyn's son Cley, who tells Bran of Stannis's proclamation. Hearing about Cersei and Jaime's incest causes Bran to remember being pushed off the tower as he dreams that night.","Tyrion takes his breakfast with Grand Maester Pycelle. He gives Pycelle two copies of a letter for Prince Doran Martell that must go out by raven at once. While Pycelle is out sending them, Tyrion goes to the Grand Maester's collection of herbs and potions and takes a vial. After breakfast, he comes across Bronn, now the captain of his personal guard, studying some knights training below. Bronn points out a hedge knight named Tallad as the best of them, but says that he falls into a rhythm. Bronn reports that Lady Tanda is looking for him again. She has been having him over for savory dinners in an effort to get him to marry her large, soft, dim-witted daughter, Lollys, who is still a maid at age thirty-three. Others begging an audience include a moneylender from Braavos looking for repayment of a loan, a river lord asking for recompense for his slaughtered peasants, some bakers, butchers, and greengrocers asking for protection after a baker was burned alive in his own oven for charging too much for bread, and Ser Alliser Thorne with a rotted hand in a jar.1 Tyrion decides he will not see Ser Alliser and orders poor quarters found for him. Bronn departs, and Tyrion continues on his way.
As Tyrion nears the main gate, he sees Cersei preparing to ride into the city with Ser Boros; Ser Balon; Lord Gyles; Hallyne the Pyromancer, Cersei's new favorite; Lancel, who is now a knight; Vylarr; and twenty Lannister house guards. She is inspecting the progress on the city's defenses and is alarmed because she has learned that Renly is marching up the roseroad towards King's Landing. His host includes all the Tyrell bannermen save the Redwynes; Lord Paxter did not march because his sons2 are hostages in the city. Tyrion is unconcerned because Renly is taking his time, feasting at every castle he passes and holding court at every crossroads. Cersei demands that Tyrion make Tywin bring his army to the city. Tyrion says that is impossible, and Cersei declares he is useless and rides off.
When Tyrion returns to his chambers, Podrick tells him that Lord Petyr awaits. Petyr beckons Tyrion over to the window to see Joffrey, guarded by Ser Preston, using hares for target practice with a crossbow. He is not hitting all that many of them. Tyrion notices that Petyr is wearing a dagger with a dragonbone hilt and knows Petyr is doing so to taunt him.3 Tyrion has been trying to find out all he can about Petyr since he is a certainly an opponent. Lord Jon Arryn gave him a minor sinecure in customs ten years ago, and he soon brought in three times as much gold as the king's other collectors. Three years later, he was master of coin and soon increased revenues to ten times their previous level, though the debt has also grown greatly in that time. All the major treasury offices and most of the minor ones are held by men he appointed. Tyrion asks if Petyr grew close to the Tullys while he was fostered there, and he states he had both Catelyn's and Lysa's maidenheads.4 Tyrion tells Petyr that he wants him to send a message to Lysa promising Lord Jon's killer, respite from mountain clan raids that have grown more intense of late, a betrothal between Myrcella and Robert, and the naming of Robert as Warden of the East in exchange for her fealty and support against Renly and Stannis. Lord Petyr asks what is in it for him, and Tyrion says Harrenhal and overlordship of the Trident.
Soon after Petyr leaves, Galt comes in to announce that Varys has arrived. Tyrion says he has a plan, and Varys says he may already know it. Tyrion tells him to continue. Varys notes that Prince Doran has called his banners but has not moved to join any side, and posits that Tyrion wants to convince him to join the Lannister cause. Tyrion says that this is correct and that he will offer the prince a seat on the small council, his sister Elia's killers, and Tommen as a ward. Varys wonders how Tyrion plans to pry both Tommen and Myrcella away from Cersei, and Tyrion says he will do it by keeping his plans a secret. Varys then asks what happens if someone tells her before the arrangements are made, and Tyrion says that he will then know who is an informant for Cersei.","Sansa ponders a note she has received, which reads, ""Come to the godswood tonight, if you want to go home."" She decides not to go, as she sees that Ser Preston is guarding the bridge and knows he will not let her pass. Later that night, she is awoken by shouts and yelling. When she looks out to the bridge again, she sees that Ser Preston is gone, so she gets dressed and goes out. On her way, she sees Ser Preston and three other Kingsguard1 getting Joffrey into his armor as he calls for his crossbow. They do not see her. When she arrives at the godswood, she meets the author of the note, Dontos.2 Dontos says he feels indebted to her and will get her out of the castle. He says that it will take time to make the preparations and that she should come to the godswood often in the meantime as it is the only safe place to meet. On her way back to her rooms, Sansa runs into Sandor, who is drunk. After mocking her a bit, he says he will take her back to her chambers. Ser Boros is on the bridge when they get there. He tells them that some commoners learned of the preparations for Tyrek's wedding feast and came to the gates demanding food. Joffrey drove them off. As they continue to walk, Sandor mocks Sansa more and asks for a song. She says she will sing him one someday, and he says that he knows she is lying. He goes on to say that the castle is full of liars, all of them better than her.","Arya peers out at a fishing village from a tree she has climbed. There appear to be people there. She, Lommy, Hot Pie, Gendry, and the little girl, whom Lommy has named Weasel, are travelling on their own. The day after Ser Amory's attack, they went back to the towerhouse and discovered Yoren's corpse among many others. Cutjack, Kurz, and Tarber were still alive in the towerhouse, however, because they got the ladder to the third floor up in time. Kurz led them for a time, but he took a wound in the shoulder pulling the ladder up and died several days later. Cutjack and Tarber abandoned the rest not long after. Arya rejoins the others and tells them about the village. Gendry has taken charge of the group and decides that he and Arya will sneak into town that night. On the way in, Gendry reveals that he knows Arya is a girl and asks who she is. Arya decides to trust him and reveals her true identity. They decide to split up to search the town. Arya goes down by the lake and sees a gibbet hung with corpses. The town is full of troops led by Gregor Clegane. After a time, she sees a commotion in town and sees that Gendry got caught. After observing some more, she returns to the others and tells Hot Pie that they have to rescue Gendry. They head back in, but Hot Pie gets startled and gasps, leading to them being discovered. Gregor comes out and interrogates Hot Pie. Some of the men1 have Arya and Hot Pie lead them to the others. Weasel has run off by the time they get there. When they learn that Lommy cannot walk, they kill him.2","Tyrion inspects the Alchemists' Guild's supply of wildfire with Hallyne. Hallyne tells him that according to Wisdom Munciter they have 7,840 jars, including 4,000 that date from Aerys II's day. Wisdom Malliard believes that the guild will be able to provide the full order of 10,000 jars that were promised to Cersei. The older jars are particularly fragile from age, however, and should probably have been destroyed, but the guild lost many of its members during the sack of King's Landing and does not have sufficient personnel to do so. A large amount of the stock made for Aerys is still missing, and some still turns up from time to time, including a cache of two hundred jars discovered the year before under the Great Sept of Baelor that no one could recall having been placed there.1 Tyrion orders several thousand empty jars to be sent to the City Watch so they may practice loading the wildfire into catapults without breaking the jars and causing fires in the city. Hallyne thanks Tyrion for his visit, saying that no Hand has graced them with his presence since Lord Rossart, who was a pyromancer himself and appointed because Aerys had a keen interest in the guild's work. Jaime has told Tyrion that Aerys used his pyromancers to roast his enemies alive.2
Timett is waiting with Tyrion's escort as he emerges from the Guildhall, as is Bronn, who informs him that Ser Jacelyn wants to see him as does Cersei. He goes to see Ser Jacelyn first, who informs him that Ser Cleos has arrived with Robb's peace terms. He sees his cousin and looks over the terms, which are unacceptable. He tells Cleos that he will discuss things with the small council and that Cleos can then return with the king's terms. When Tyrion returns to his chambers, Cersei is waiting for him in a foul mood. Tyrion is not pleased that she got into his chambers unannounced and knows that Crawn will be even less pleased because his Moon Brothers are on guard that day. Cersei is furious that Tyrion has sent Doran Martell an offer betrothing Myrcella to Doran's son Trystane. He plans to send Myrcella to Dorne as a guest, with Ser Arys to serve as her sworn shield, until she turns fourteen, at which point she will marry Trystane. Doran will also get the land, small council seat, and justice that Tyrion told Varys about.3 Tyrion says it is necessary to secure Dorne's support and that Myrcella would otherwise likely end up dead when King's Landing falls. At this point, Cersei does something completely unexpected; she bursts into tears. Tyrion does his best to reassure her that the war is going well, but she is loath to accept comfort from him. He shows her the peace terms and says it is a good starting point. He is pleased because he knows she will have to accept the offer to Dorne, and he has uncovered an informer.3","Bran rides Dancer into the Great Hall to inaugurate the harvest feast. People in attendance include Rickon, Ser Rodrik, Maester Luwin, Lord Wyman, Lady Donella, Leobald, Cley, Hother, Mors, Mikken, Hodor, Osha, Joseth, Little Walder, Big Walder, Beth, Old Nan, Farlen, Hayhead, Tym and Skittrick. Part way through the feast, Alebelly enters to announce the arrival of Meera and Jojen Reed, who reaffirm the loyalty of the crannogmen to Winterfell and join the feast. Soon after the dancing begins, Bran takes his leave and returns to his room. As he lies in bed, he remembers how his father once told him that Ser Arthur Dayne would have killed him if not for Howland Reed. Once asleep, he finds himself inside the wolf dream as Summer. Summer and Shaggydog note strangers approaching. It is Meera and Jojen. Jojen comes forward to touch Summer, and when he does, Bran is knocked out of the wolf dream.","Catelyn is riding south with twenty Winterfell guards, including Hallis and Shadd, and five lordlings, including Ser Wendel, Robin, Lucas Blackwood, and Ser Perwyn Frey, as an escort. She had not wanted to be the one to treat with Renly, but Robb convinced her there was no one else. Robb was preparing to march as she took her leave. The riverlands are dangerous, but the war has not passed south of the Blackwater. As they ride, they soon encounter a scouting party led by Ser Colen of Greenpools. He tells her that Renly is camped near Bitterbridge, where the roseroad crosses the Mander, and that he will escort her there. As they get close to the Mander, the huge host becomes visible clustered around thousands of campfires. A great melee is being held next to the castle of Bitterbridge in front of a large crowd. As they ride up, a knight bearing the colors of House Tarth unhorses Red Ronnet Connington. Ser Colen tells Catelyn to have her men wait there, and he will present her to King Renly. As she approaches the dais, she notes some of his lords and ladies, including Lord Mathis Rowan, Lord Randyll Tarly, and Lady Arwyn Oakheart. At the center of them sits Renly with his new wife, Margaery. The melee is almost over now, with only four knights remaining. The Tarth knight quickly unhorses two of them, leaving the crowd favorite, Loras, as the final opponent. Loras almost finishes it, but the Tarth knight manages to turn the tide and defeat him. Catelyn asks Ser Colen who the knight is and is shocked to learn she is a woman, Brienne of Tarth, daughter of Lord Selwyn. Renly declares her champion of the field of 116 knights and says he will give her any reward she asks. She asks to join his Rainbow Guard, and he gives his assent. She is anointed Brienne the Blue. Ser Colen brings Catelyn forward. Renly says he will see justice done for Eddard. Lord Caswell has given Renly use of his castle, so he gives her use of his royal pavilion and offers her a place at the feast to be held that night.
That night, Catelyn is seated between Lord Mathis and Ser Jon Fossoway. Others at the feast include Brienne; Lord Willum and his sons, Josua and Elyas; Lord Steffon Varner; Lord Bryce Caron, Ser Robar Royce, and Ser Guyard Morrigen of the Rainbow Guard; Ser Mark Mullendore; and Ser Tanton Fossoway. Renly sits with Margaery on his left and Ser Loras on his right. Catelyn realizes that they are all so young and unblooded and labels them ""the knights of summer."" Renly bids her leave the hall with him. He asks if Ser Barristan had been sighted at Riverrun and is disappointed that he has disappeared.1 He had been saving Brienne's spot on the Rainbow Guard for him. He takes her to the battlements of the castle to gaze out at his army. He says he has 80,000, with 10,000 more at Highgarden commanded by Lord Mace and a strong garrison at Storm's End. He will triumph. If Robb bends the knee and joins him, he can keep his titles, even King in the North, and rule as he pleases, but he must swear fealty. Catelyn mentions Stannis's right to the throne, and Renly counters that he would make an appalling king. Renly plans to win the throne as Robert won his, through force of arms. As they talk, a rider appears and calls for the king. Renly announces himself, and the rider declares that Storm's End is besieged by Stannis.","Jon rides next to Lord Commander Mormont in a blinding rainstorm. The expedition has passed seven deserted wildling villages. They hear a horn in the distance, signaling that Craster is still at his keep. Craster is said to be half-mad and to consort with unsavory powers, but he has always provided shelter to the Watch and has no love for Mance Rayder. Lord Commander Mormont sends Jon down the column to spread the word that they will be stopping at Craster's Keep. On the way, Jon runs into Sam, who is miserable and wet, but holding up okay. Sam tells him that Craster is the bastard of a wildling and a ranger and that he marries his own daughters. Jon rides to the rear of the column to report to Ser Ottyn, who is happy that a rest is coming. Jon takes a shortcut through the woods to get back to the head of the column and runs into Dywen and Grenn. Soon after, Ghost emerges too. He rides into Craster's Keep and spies Dolorous Edd tending to Lord Commander Mormont's horse. Edd informs him that the Lord Commander is in the hall.
When Jon enters, he sees Lord Commander Mormont flanked by Jarmen and Thoren and about two dozen senior rangers seated on benches. Craster sits in a seat at the head of the hall. Craster says that he has not seen Benjen, but that Ser Waymar did come through. Craster says he also knows much about what Mance is doing, but will only tell them for a price. He asks for a new axe, which the Lord Commander grants him. Craster says the expedition can stay one night and that any man who touches one of his wives loses a hand. Mormont sends Jon to fetch the axe and bring Sam to draw a map. As he searches for Sam, he hears a commotion and a cry of ""Wolf!"" He discovers Ghost, who has gotten into a rabbit hutch, and one of Craster's wives, who is young and pregnant. He tries to calm her down, but Lark the Sisterman and Chett come up and taunt her and she runs off. After a brief altercation with the two, Jon walks off to look for Sam again.
Giant points Jon in the right direction, and he finds Sam sheltering under a rock. They eat one of the rabbits Ghost found, and Sam goes off to find the Lord Commander. The next morning, Jon wakes up to a frozen wonderland, as the night's chill has turned yesterday's rain into a thin sheet of ice. The girl he encountered approaches him and begs him to take her when he leaves. She identifies herself as Gilly, says that Sam sent her, and says she fears for her child. If it is a girl, there will be no problem, but Nella told her the baby will be a boy, in which case Craster will give him to the Others, as he always does. Jon joins Dywen, Grenn, and Hake for breakfast. He attends Lord Commander Mormont after that. He sees Sam with Gilly and approaches him. Sam has promised Gilly that on the way back he will help her, and Jon is angry. The Watch leaves Craster's Keep. Jon tells Lord Commander Mormont about Craster's sacrifices, but he responds that the Watch has always known, and there is nothing to be done. He also reveals to Jon that Craster has told him that Mance is gathering his people in the Frostfangs. This is inhospitable ground, so the only reason he can be gathering is to throw his strength against the Wall. The wildlings have done this several times throughout history. The most recent invasion was led by Raymun Redbeard in the time of Eddard's great-grandfather, and before that there was Bael the Bard, the Horned Lord, the brothers Gendel and Gorne, and Joramun, who is said to have blown the Horn of Winter and woken giants from the earth. The Lord Commander means to find Mance Rayder and stop him.","Theon is admiring his new longship when an attractive young woman walks up. She says her name is Esgred and that she is the daughter of Ambrode and the wife of Sigrin, Lord Balon's personal shipwright. Theon makes advances and banters a bit. During the course of the conversation, he is inspired to name his new ship Sea Bitch. At the conclusion of the banter, Theon convinces Esgred to come back to Pyke with him. They walk into Lordsport, which is packed with people. Lord Gorold Goodbrother had arrived the night before, and his men are everywhere. It is said that Otter Gimpknee's whores are being overused due to the influx of people. As they walk through town, Esgred calls out to several men, including a longship captain named Bluetooth whose wife is pregnant, two warriors named Qarl and Uller, and a third warrior named Skyte, whose brother, Eldiss, recently died after drinking too much. Theon fetches his new squire, Wex, a mute bastard of one of Lord Sawane Botley's half brothers,1 out of an inn and has him get the horses. Esgred rides with Theon on his horse, Smiler, a temperamental black stallion Theon purchased from Lord Sawane. Theon is overly familiar with Esgred on the ride back, fondling her several times. She asks about his family. He says that his sister Asha is not a man no matter what she wears and he will make a marriage alliance with her after the war, that Aeron is drunk on his god, and that Victarion is strong and dutiful, but not an independent thinker. He did sail into Lannisport to destroy the Lannister fleet at anchor at the beginning of Balon Greyjoy's Rebellion, but the plan was Euron's. Euron himself has been gone for two years and is an infamous pirate. Esgred points out that the ironmen would not want a stranger as their ruler. When they reach Pyke, she reveals that she is really his sister, Asha.
That night, Theon goes down to a feast. There are near four hundred captains there from most of the notable houses, Harlaws from Harlaw, Blacktydes from Blacktyde, Sparrs, Merlyns, and Goodbrothers from Great Wyk, Saltcliffes and Sunderlys from Saltcliffe, and Botleys and Wynches from Pyke. All that remains is for Dagmer Cleftjaw to return from Old Wyk with the Stonehouses and Drumms. When Theon arrives, he is annoyed to see Asha sitting at the place of honor on his father's right. He tells her she is in his seat, and she only mocks him. He asks if their father knows she married a shipwright, and she merely replies that Esgred was the name of Sigrin's mother and the first ship he built. He asks if she is really with child, and she claims she is, calling for a man named Rolfe to throw an axe to her, which she slams down on her trencher, splattering Theon with gravy. She says the axe is her husband and the dirk nestled between her breasts is her suckling babe. The hall erupts in laughter directed at Theon. Asha tells him that he had best rethink his attitude if he means to be accepted by his people. He says he is their lawful prince, and Asha responds that the laws of the green lands do not apply on the Iron Islands.
After the feast, Lord Balon withdraws with Victarion, Aeron, Asha, and Theon to reveal his plans. The fleet will sail as soon as Dagmer returns with the Stonehouses and Drumms. He says that Theon, along with Aeron and Dagmer, will raid the Stony Shore with eight longships as a diversion. Asha will take thirty longships around Sea Dragon Point and seize Deepwood Motte. The main thrust will be launched by Victarion, who will sail up the Saltspear and the Fever River to take Moat Cailin. With Moat Cailin in hand, Robb will be blocked from returning north, and even if he tries his enemies in the south will crush him. Theon is furious that he is to be just a small diversion. After the meeting, Asha taunts him some more.","Ser Meryn admits Tyrion to Cersei's chambers, where she is listening to Lancel sing. Tyrion asks to speak to her in private, and Lancel leaves. Tyrion informs Cersei that Stannis has besieged Storm's End and that Renly is riding to meet him. They share a laugh at their good fortune, and Cersei even hugs Tyrion for a moment. They share a cup of wine to celebrate, and Tyrion poisons hers. The next morning, Cersei is indisposed as planned, leaving Tyrion to meet with Ser Cleos without her interference. He ascends the Iron Throne, flanked by Bronn and Ser Preston. Courtiers in attendance include Sansa, Lord Gyles, Ser Ilyn, Ser Horas, Ser Hobber, and Tyrek, who married Lady Ermesande three days ago and is now mocked as ""Wet Nurse"" by his fellow squires. Lord Petyr, Varys, and Pycelle are also present. Ser Cleos enters, and Tyrion gives him alternate terms to send back to Robb. Robb must swear fealty and return to Winterfell. Jaime is to be freed and Robb's host placed in his command to march on Stannis and Renly. Each of Robb's bannermen must send a son, or a daughter if without sons, to King's Landing to serve as hostages. As to prisoner exchanges, Tyrion will trade Harrion Karstark and Ser Wylis Manderly for Willem Lannister and Lord Medger Cerwyn and Ser Donnel Locke for Tion Frey, because any Lannister is worth two northmen. Ice, Sansa, and Arya will be returned when these terms are met; Eddard's bones will be returned now as a gesture of goodwill. During the course of announcing these terms, Tyrion reveals that Prince Doran has consented to betroth Trystane to Myrcella and declare for Joffrey. Tyrion decrees that Vylarr and his entire guard will escort Ser Cleos back to Riverrun. Vylarr is aghast, but there is little he can do.
When the audience concludes, Ser Alliser forces his way to the floor and demands to be heard. He wants to speak to the king, but Tyrion says he is unavailable. Ser Alliser recounts the incident with the wights1 and warns of a grave threat in the far north, though he no longer has the wight hand to show, as it rotted away while he was kept waiting. He is mocked by nearly all present, including Tyrion, who nevertheless promises to see that he gets recruits from the dungeons and streets. After the audience, Lord Petyr speaks to him angrily for deceiving him about Myrcella and leaves. Tyrion confers with Varys. He says that Cersei will consent to having the guard sent away because it is part of his plan to free Jaime. He has recruited a poisoner, a thief, a mummer, and a murderer and plans to send them to Riverrun disguised as guardsmen. Ser Cleos leaves that afternoon.
At midnight, Tyrion, accompanied by Timett, Shagga, and some of their men, pays a visit to Grand Maester Pycelle. They discover him in bed with his young female servant. Tyrion has Timett escort the girl out and then gets down to business. He accuses Pycelle of giving one of the letters for Doran to Cersei instead. Pycelle denies it and tries to blame Varys, but Tyrion reveals that he told Petyr and Varys different stories about which royal children were being fostered where so that he would know which one spoke to the queen. Pycelle still denies it until Shagga begins to shave the Grand Maester's beard with his axe. Pycelle pleads his loyalty to House Lannister, saying it was he who convinced Aerys II to open the gates of King's Landing when Tywin came. With Rhaegar dead, Aerys mad, and Viserys and Aegon too young, he had hoped Tywin would become king. Tyrion also accuses him of killing Lord Jon, but Pycelle claims he tried to save him. After a little more prodding from Shagga, he admits that he let the poison run its course, but continues to deny doing the actual poisoning.2 He says that Jon knew of Cersei's incest and that even though the queen never gave him a direct order, he could see that she wanted it done. Tyrion tells Shagga to lock Pycelle in one of the black cells.","Ser Gregor keeps Arya, Gendry, Hot Pie, and the villagers imprisoned for eight days. Every day he, with the aid of the Tickler, questions one villager about the town and about Lord Beric. The villager never survives. After that, Gregor marches them to Harrenhal to serve there. Arya gets to know Gregor's men along the way, including Dunsen, Raff the Sweetling, who killed Lommy, Chiswyck, Shitmouth, and Polliver, who took Needle from her. Each night, she says a litany of all those she hates: Ser Gregor, Dunsen, Polliver, Chiswyck, Raff the Sweetling, the Tickler, the Hound, Ser Amory, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, King Joffrey, and Queen Cersei. When they finally arrive at Harrenhal, Arya, now going by the name Weasel, is brought before Goodwife Amabel and Goodwife Harra, who assign her to the Wailing Tower, where the servants are controlled by an understeward named Weese.","Daenerys rides into Qarth on her silver flanked by Aggo, Jhogo, and Rakharo and with Drogon riding on her shoulders. Ser Jorah tells her that he does not trust any of the seekers and thinks they should leave Qarth quickly. They ride to Xaro's palace, where Daenerys is to stay. Xaro leaves, promising that the Thirteen and many more will come to see her and give her gifts. Pyat takes his leave, promising to petition the Undying Ones for an audience. Quaithe departs, telling her to beware those who will come to see her dragons. Daenerys sends Rakharo to explore the city and Ser Jorah down to the docks for news. While they are gone, she bathes and thinks. She has doubts about how she can take back the Seven Kingdoms. As Irri and Jhiqui dry and dress her, she thinks that her comet led her to Qarth for a purpose and she will find what she needs there. That evening, as she is feeding Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion, Ser Jorah returns with a Summer Islander named Quhuru Mo, captain of the ship Cinnamon Wind out of Tall Trees Town. Quhuru tells her that Robert is dead and the realm at war. Daenerys promises him a reward when she has her throne, and he leaves. Ser Jorah preaches caution and warns her that the Seven Kingdoms are still strong and she will need strong armies, but Daenerys now has hope that she can take Westeros while it is divided.","Bran and Summer are playing with Meera and Jojen. While the other lords left after the harvest feast, they have stayed. Ser Rodrik is away dealing with trouble in the east. Ramsay Snow seized Lady Donella on her way back from the feast and subsequently married her, while Lord Wyman occupied her castle to ""protect"" her lands. Ser Rodrik is trying to sort it out. Jojen tells Bran that he should leave Winterfell. He explains that he has the greensight; he has dreams that show him the future. Bran asks Jojen to tell him more, but Jojen demands that Bran tell him of his dreams first. Bran does not want to. Jojen tells him that he dreamed of a wolf with wings in chains and the three-eyed crow trying to break him free. It was the crow that first gave Jojen the greensight, visiting him in his dreams when he nearly died of greywater fever as a child. Bran blurts out how the crow came to him after he fell and told him to fly or die, and Jojen responds he is now sure the three-eyed crow sent him and Meera to free Bran from his chains. When Jojen told Lord Howland of the dream, he sent Meera and Jojen to Winterfell. He says Bran must open his third eye and go to the three-eyed crow in the far north beyond the Wall and also tells him that when he dreams he is a wolf, he is actually entering Summer. Bran gets angry with Jojen's questions and Summer attacks, soon joined by Shaggydog. Meera and Jojen climb into a tree and Bran calls Hodor to chase the direwolves off. Jojen says they will talk again later. Bran goes to see Maester Luwin and tells him about Jojen's claims. Maester Luwin tells Bran that magic is gone from the world. Maester Luwin studied magic for a time at the Citadel and even received a link of Valyrian steel, but he tried his hand at some of the spells himself, and they did not work. When Bran tells this to Meera, she tells him one of Jojen's dreams. He dreamed that Bran was having dinner with Big Walder and Little Walder. Maester Luwin served them. Bran got the king's cut of the meat and the Walders' meat was cold and dead yet they relished their supper more.1 She says that when Bran understands, they will talk again. In the evening, Bran has supper with the Walders but he can see nothing wrong with their food and thinks that Maester Luwin had the truth of it. However, he laments that magic no longer exists.","Podrick wakes up Tyrion and informs him that Lancel is waiting to see him. Lancel is there on behalf of Cersei to demand the release of Grand Maester Pycelle. Ser Jacelyn has already refused her, and she wants him removed from his post. Lancel acts defiant until Tyrion brings up his part in Robert's death and the fact that Cersei is bedding him, a tidbit recently learned from Varys. Tyrion threatens to tell Joffrey that Lancel killed his father to bed his mother, and a terrified Lancel begs for mercy. Tyrion tells him to continue staying close to Cersei but to report to him everything she does. Lancel promises he will. Tyrion also warns him not to get the queen with child, and he reveals that he spills his seed on her belly. Tyrion promises to release Pycelle, but states that his days on the small council are over. As to Ser Jacelyn, he tells Lancel to convince Cersei that he can win over the commander with time, so as to forestall a move by her. Deciding he will not be able to sleep again, Tyrion summons Bronn and rides to Chataya's brothel. Alayaya is occupied at the moment, so he waits while Chataya summons her. As he waits, another whore, Dancy, tries to entice him, but he rebuffs her. Alayaya leads him to the turret room so he can go to see Shae, while explaining that Dancy has a fortnight to get Tyrion to choose her or she will lose a bet with another whore, Marei. When he arrives at the manse, Tyrion goes to Shae's chambers and pleasures her. He realizes he loves her.","Arya spends most of her days cleaning. Hot Pie works in the kitchens, and Gendry in the forge. Weese is a cruel taskmaster who is quick to beat his charges or set his dog on them. Arya continues to say the litany of those she despises every night, now with Weese at the head of the list. She means to kill every one of them. As she works, she overhears many conversations and learns many secrets from around the castle. She learns that Pia from the buttery is a slut who is working her way through every knight in the castle. The wife of the gaoler is with child, but the real father is either Ser Alyn Stackspear or a singer called Whitesmile Wat. Lord Leo Lefford made mock of ghosts at table, but always keeps a candle burning by his bed. Ser Dunaver's squire Jodge could not hold his water when he slept. The cooks despise Ser Harys Swyft and spit in all his food. She also learns that Maester Tothmure received a letter stating that Joffrey is a bastard and that Stannis has crowned himself king. Many of the soldiers doubt that Joffrey will be able to keep the throne long.
The Brave Companions1 ride in one day with Vargo Hoat at their head and cause an altercation that leaves Ser Harys's squire dead. They leave several days later. Before they go, Arya overhears one say that Lord Roose has occupied the ruby ford of the Trident. She also learns that northmen captives from the battle of the Green Fork are in the castle. They mostly have free reign of the place in return for a pledge not to escape. The four Freys2 are soon after ransomed and freed. Ser Wylis Manderly is haunting the kitchens and Harrion Karstark wanders the battlements. Lord Medger Cerwyn has a serious wound and eventually dies. Several days later, Ser Amory rides into the keep with his men, including Biter, Rorge, and Jaqen. None appear to recognize her, but that night Jaqen comes to speak to her. He tells her that she saved three lives and that he will repay her by killing three people of her choice. She avoids him for a few days, but then is called upon to serve several of Ser Gregor's men, fresh returned from foraging and a skirmish with Lord Beric that cost them four men. She overhears Chiswyck telling a story to Raff and several others about how the two of them, Eggon, Tobbot, and Gregor's squire Joss Stillwood were at an alehouse with Gregor on the way back west after the Hand's tournament and gang raped a brewer's daughter named Layna. A disgusted Arya finds Jaqen and whispers the name Chiswyck. Three days later, she learns that Chiswyck appears to have fallen off the wall and broken his neck. That night, her litany contains one less name.","Lady Catelyn, flanked by Ser Wendel and Hallis, arrives at an empty field, the chosen meeting place for a parley between Stannis and Renly. Storm's End looms in the distance. It was built in ancient days by the legendary first Storm King, Durran, who is said to have married the daughter of the sea god and wind goddess, Elenei, and needed a strong fortress to protect him from their wrath since the marriage doomed her to a mortal lifespan. The gods are said to have destroyed his hold and his first five attempts at rebuilding with storms before he finally built a fortress that could withstand their rage. Lord Stannis arrives with Melisandre. Renly arrives soon after with Brienne. The brothers exchange taunts and threats with each other. Lady Catelyn tries to get them to cooperate, but they will not listen. Stannis even tells her that Robb is a traitor and will have his day too. Renly tells Stannis that if he surrenders, he can have Storm's End. Stannis refuses to receive what is his by right. Catelyn points out that Stannis is not the rightful king either and learns about Cersei's incest. It was Lord Stannis who first became suspicious, and he went to Lord Jon because he felt that the accusation coming from his own mouth would not be believed. Catelyn is inclined to believe him, but Renly continues to think it but a story. Renly pulls out a peach and eats it, threatening and mocking Stannis as he does. Stannis draws out Lightbringer, which glows brightly. He tells Renly he will give him until the morning to strike his banners. If he does, he will keep Storm's End and his small council seat and be named heir. If he does not, he will die. Renly is unbelieving, as he has Stannis greatly outnumbered and flaunts his power by naming many of the great houses that have joined him, including Tyrell, Rowan, Tarly, Caron, Tarth, Penrose, Fossoway, Cuy, Mullendore, Estermont, Selmy, Hightower, Oakheart, Crane, Caswell, Blackbar, Morrigen, Beesbury, Shermer, Dunn, Footly, and Florent. Melisandre tells him to look to his sins as they depart.
Renly and Catelyn return to Renly's camp. It is smaller now, because he left his foot at Bitterbridge and dashed to Storm's End with his horse. They return to his tent, where his bannermen wait. Lord Mathis counsels leaving Stannis to his siege, as Ser Cortnay Penrose is strongly provisioned and the castle too strong to storm. Lord Randyll counters that Stannis is a danger that should be dealt with before he grows stronger. The others agree, and Renly decides to face him on the morrow. Catelyn asks leave to return to Riverrun, but Renly refuses. He wants her to observe the coming battle and report to Robb firsthand what happens to those who oppose him. Lord Mathis will command the center, Lord Bryce the left, and Renly himself the right. Lord Estermont will lead the reserve. Lord Randyll, Ser Jon, Ser Guyard, and several others clamor for the honor of leading the van, but Renly gives the honor to Loras. Brienne will carry Renly's banner beside him. She protests being sent from Renly's side and asks the honor of at least dressing him for battle. Catelyn realizes that she loves him. She asks leave to pray at a nearby sept, and Renly grants that request, telling Ser Robar of his Rainbow Guard to escort her. They pass through her camp on the way, where Hallis, Shadd, and Lucas are resting. She tells them there will be a battle. Lucas asks whether they will fight or flee and Catelyn answers that they will pray.","Sandor escorts Sansa to see Joffrey, who is angry because of Robb. Joffrey is in the lower bailey shooting animals with his crossbow. He is guarded by Ser Boros and Ser Meryn. Others in attendance include Lord Gyles, Ser Horas, Ser Hobber, Ser Lancel, and Dontos. Joffrey informs Sansa that Robb fell upon Ser Stafford's army in the night and destroyed it. She is there to pay for his crimes. Joffrey orders her beaten. Dontos tries to save her by hitting her with a melon for the amusement of the court, but Joffrey is not placated. He has Ser Boros hit her. After several blows, Sandor says they have done enough, but Joffrey orders her stripped naked to continue the beating. At that moment, Tyrion arrives with Bronn and Timett and puts a stop to it. Sandor gives Sansa his white cloak to cover herself. After lecturing Joffrey, Tyrion has Sansa taken to the Tower of the Hand where she is bathed. Maester Frenken then gives her a salve for her bruises and a draught to help her sleep.
Sansa wakes up that night and tries to leave, but Chella, who is guarding the door, does not let her. A serving girl brings food and drink. Soon after, Tyrion arrives. He explains what happened. Robb and his army fell upon Ser Stafford's host at the village of Oxcross, three days ride from Casterly Rock. His men cut the horse lines and Grey Wind went among them to drive them mad. Many knights were trampled in their tents and the sellswords broke and ran. Ser Stafford was killed by Lord Rickard. Also among those reported slain were Ser Rupert Brax, Ser Lymond Vikary, Lord Roland Crakehall, and Lord Antario Jast.1 Martyn Lannister was among the captured. How Robb bypassed the Golden Tooth remains a mystery.2 Tyrion speaks to her kindly and informs her that he means to see she never weds Joffrey, but Sansa does not trust him. He offers to let her stay in the Tower of the Hand, but she declines because she is afraid she will not be able to meet Dontos anymore and escape.","Catelyn prays in the sept as Ser Wendel and Ser Robar wait outside. As she prays, she reflects on many subjects, including the former septon of Riverrun, Osmynd; her mother,1 who died in childbirth along with her newborn son; and Cersei. Catelyn believes that the children were incestuous based on all the evidence and believes that is why Bran was pushed off the tower. Ser Robar comes in when it is time to go. They approach Renly's tent, which is guarded by two of the Rainbow Guard, Ser Emmon Cuy and Ser Parmen Crane. Renly is inside. Brienne is dressing him for battle while Lord Mathis and Lord Randyll confer with him. Both want to launch the attack immediately, but Renly insists on waiting until dawn since that is when Stannis expects him and he does not want to win through treachery. He also orders that Stannis's corpse not be desecrated. Lord Randyll asks what to do if Stannis yields and Mathis says that is unlikely considering his obstinacy at the siege of Storm's End during Robert's Rebellion. Renly agrees and tells how the master-at-arms, Ser Gawen Wylde, and three other knights had tried to sneak out of the castle and were caught by Stannis. He decided to hurl them over the walls with a catapult and already had Gawen strapped down when Maester Cressen convinced him that they might eventually have to eat their dead and there was no point in wasting good meat. Ser Gawen was placed in a cell instead, where he died before the siege was lifted. After the two lords leave, Catelyn says her piece. She tells Renly of Bran's accident and its implications and tells Renly that he, Stannis, and Robb should set aside their crowns and call a Great Council to prove the incest and choose a new king. Renly does not like the idea at all. He is about to say more when a shadow enters the room and slits his throat. Brienne holds him as he dies. Ser Emmon and Ser Robar come rushing in. Ser Emmon attacks Brienne immediately with two men-at-arms. Ser Robar hesitates, and Catelyn pleads with him, swearing Brienne's innocence and asserting that it was Stannis who did it somehow. Ser Robar agrees to hold the others at bay. Catelyn stuns Ser Emmon with a brazier, and she and Brienne escape out the back of the tent. Catelyn tells Brienne about the shadow and swears she could feel Stannis's presence inside the tent. Brienne swears she will kill him. They return to Catelyn's escort, and Catelyn tells Hallis to prepare to ride. Ser Wendel and Ser Perwyn form up beside her, and she tells Brienne to take a horse and come with them.","Jon rides with Lord Commander Mormont and the other officers to the summit of the Fist of the First Men. Ghost refused to come up with him, running off three times. Lord Commander Mormont decides they will camp there to await Qhorin and the men from the Shadow Tower. Jon goes down to fetch Ghost, but he again refuses to go to the summit. Jon stares out at the terrain until dusk and then talks briefly with Sam, who seems to be finding a little courage. He then goes to find the Lord Commander, who is meeting with the senior officers, including Thoren, Jarmen, Ser Mallador, and Ser Ottyn. Lord Commander Mormont means to wait at the Fist for the wildlings to emerge, as the only path they can take is down the Milkwater and past the Fist. Jon takes his leave to get some supper as the Lord Commander goes to bed. Dywen is talking to Grenn, Dolorous Edd, and Hake and says that it smells cold. Jon loses his appetite and wanders off. Ghost appears and beckons him to follow. After leading him down the hill and around in the underbrush for a bit, Ghost starts digging. He uncovers a stash of dragonglass weapons, daggers and arrowheads, and a hunting horn. They have not been there long. Jon picks up the cloth they were wrapped in and realizes that it is the cloak of a member of the Night's Watch.","Alebelly comes to get Bran because there has been a message from Robb. He takes him to Maester Luwin's turret, where Rickon, Big Walder, and Little Walder have already gathered. Maester Luwin tells them of the victory at Oxcross and also that Robb has taken several castles, including Ashemark, the seat of House Marbrand. Ser Stevron took a wound in the fighting at Oxcross and died three days later. The Walders are not particularly upset, and Bran realizes that this is the fulfillment of Jojen's dream.1 The Walders proceed to debate who is next in line, with Little Walder asking if it is Ser Emmon and Big Walder pointing out that Stevron's eldest son Ryman is next, followed by his sons Edwyn, Black Walder, and Petyr, then Aegon and all his sons.2 Bran asks to be excused and Osha comes and takes him back to his room. Jojen and Meera arrive soon after. Jojen tells him that he dreamt of the sea rising to drown Winterfell and many men drowned, including Alebelly, Septon Chayle, and Mikken.3 Bran tells them of his dreams, and Jojen once again tells him he must open his third eye. Bran tries to warn Alebelly, Septon Chayle, and Mikken, but he is not believed, except by Alebelly who does not bathe for a week for fear of drowning. Ser Rodrik returns several days later with a prisoner, Reek.4 Ramsay is dead,5 but so is Lady Donella. After the marriage, Ramsay locked her in a tower and starved her to death. Before she died, she signed a will naming Ramsay her heir. Now Bolton and Manderly men are fighting in the Hornwood lands. Maester Luwin says that men have been raiding the Stony Shore.6 Leobald has sent Benfred to deal with them. Bran tells Ser Rodrik about Jojen's dream, but he is no more believing than anyone else. That night, Bran talks to Jojen again, who tells him that he saw Reek murdering Bran and Rickon and skinning off their faces. Jojen says they are going to die and there is nothing that can be done.7","Varys reports to Cersei, Tyrion, and Petyr that Renly is dead. Renly's foot remains at Bitterbridge, but most of his followers at Storm's End have gone over to Stannis. Lord Alester Florent was the first to go over, but Loras Tyrell, Mathis Rowan, and Randyll Tarly did not. Ser Cortnay still holds out in Storm's End. In all, one-fifth of Renly's knights left with Loras. Loras slew Ser Robar and Ser Emmon in a blind rage when he learned of Renly's death. Tyrion tells the others that this is an opportunity. He proposes they send an envoy to Bitterbridge to treat with Loras and win the Tyrells to their side. As part of the deal, they should betroth Joffrey to Margaery. Cersei resists the betrothal proposal at first, but relents. Cersei and Tyrion try to make each other the envoy to get a rival out of the city, and Petyr volunteers to go instead. He negotiates an escort of three hundred gold cloaks and twenty knights. Ser Hobber will be part of the escort and released to woo Lord Paxter. Lord Petyr says he will ride out before morning. When the meeting is over, Cersei, flanked by Ser Preston, tells Tyrion that he has been a big help and even kisses him on the brow. Tyrion thinks she is planning something and tells Bronn to find out what.","Benfred Tallhart spits on and insults Theon while being held by Stygg and Werlag. Aeron says he must die for it. Aeron takes him down to the shore and drowns him. Theon looks down on his men, including Tymor, Urzen, Black Lorren, Todric, Maron Botley, and Gevin Harlaw, as they loot the dead and finish off the wounded. Todric gets into a fight over loot, and Theon has Wex fetch his bow and gives Todric an arrow in the belly. Theon returns to Sea Bitch. He ponders the battle. They raided the fishing village before dawn and burned it to the ground. Benfred and his men came down the road, singing, without a single scout deployed. The ambush made quick work of them. Dagmer hails Theon from his ship, Foamdrinker. Theon had left him to guard the ships so that he would not get credit for the victory. Theon says they must talk, and Dagmer invites him aboard his ship. Theon says that they should not be doing reaving work and that he means to do something that will place them in the songs. He also flatters Dagmer by calling him the greatest warrior of the Iron Islands. Dagmer demurs, stating that he is old and Andrik the Unsmiling, a warrior in service to House Drumm, now has the most skill and renown, but it is clear he is interested. Theon plans to give Aeron six longships and have him continue the raiding. At the same time, Dagmer will take most of their men and pretend to besiege Torrhen's Square to draw Ser Rodrik away from Winterfell. Theon will then take the defenseless castle.","Lord Tywin is preparing to march. Ser Addam left the day before with the outriders. Arya is worried that all the people she hates will be leaving and that Jaqen will too before she can have anyone else killed. She learns that Ser Gregor and his men will go, as Ser Gregor will lead the van, but Ser Amory is staying as castellan of Harrenhal. Vargo Hoat will be staying as well. Weese has her carry various messages all day. She goes to the forge to see the blacksmith, Lucan, about a sword for Ser Lyonel. Gendry tells her that Hot Pie asked him if Arya had yelled Winterfell during the battle at the holdfast. Gendry told him he heard wrong, and he warns Arya to be careful. Weese hits her for taking too long getting the sword, and Arya resolves to have him killed. On her way to take a message to Tuffleberry, the brewer, she runs into Rorge, who threatens her until she mentions Jaqen's name. He grows fearful and tells her he is in the bathhouse. She goes there and whispers Weese's name in Jaqen's ear before delivering the message to the brewer. The next morning, the Lannister host marches out with Lord Tywin and Ser Kevan at its head. Ser Gregor rides out near the end with Polliver carrying his banner. She realizes that she should have called for Tywin's death and tries to find Jaqen, hoping it is not too late. She hears a commotion and sees Weese lying on the ground with his dog taking bites out of his corpse. Amabel says the ghosts of Harrenhal caused the death. Arya looks up to the walls and sees Jaqen, who casually lays two fingers against his cheek.","Catelyn, Ser Wendel, Ser Perwyn, Robin, Lucas, Hallis, and the rest of Catelyn's party are discovered by Frey outriders. Martyn Rivers commands the outriders with Robb away in the west, and Ser Edmure holds Riverrun. The scouts take her to Martyn, who tells her about Robb's victories and Tywin's march. Rymund the Rhymer, a singer newly come to Riverrun, has composed a song in honor of Robb. Robb is now raiding throughout the westerlands. Lord Rickard and Galbart are raiding along the coast, while Lady Maege has captured thousands of cattle and the Greatjon has seized the gold mines at Castamere, Nunn's Deep, and Pendric Hills. Ser Perwyn asks how Robb got past the Golden Tooth, and Martyn reveals that Grey Wind found a small path that bypassed the fortress. That night, Brienne comes to Catelyn and asks leave to depart. She means to find and kill Stannis. Catelyn manages to convince her that she would just be throwing her life away, and Brienne decides to serve Catelyn. Catelyn accepts her oath. The party begins the ride back to Riverrun. They cross a ford guarded by Mallister men and later come across a Blackwood camp, where Lucas takes his leave. She sees another camp full of Pipers, Darrys, and Paeges and realizes that Edmure has called the banners again and means to do battle with Tywin. As they approach Riverrun, they see some Lannisters hanging from the walls.
Edmure rides out to greet Catelyn with Ser Desmond, Ser Robin, and Utherydes. He says that Ser Cortnay has sent birds promising allegiance to any king that will lift Stannis's siege. Ser Cortnay says he fears for Edric Storm. Apparently, Stannis has offered to let the garrison go free unharmed if they deliver Edric into his custody. Catelyn asks about the hanged men, and Edmure explains that they came with Ser Cleos and tried to free Jaime.1 One of them killed two guards with his bare hands while another picked the lock of Jaime's cell. Another one was a mummer, and impersonated Ser Edmure to get three guards, Enger, Delp, and Long Lew, to open the gates. The plot failed because Edmure was actually whoring outside the castle. When Long Lew saw him returning, he raised the alarm. Jaime got hold of a sword, killed Poul Pemford and Ser Desmond's squire, Myles, and seriously wounded Delp before being subdued. Jaime is now in one of the black cells and chained to a wall. Those who aided him were hanged. Ser Cleos, though he claimed no knowledge of the plan, was locked in Jaime's old tower cell.
When they enter the castle, the grounds are overrun with smallfolk. Edmure took them in because they were afraid, but Catelyn thinks that it just makes for more mouths to feed if there is a siege. She thinks that Edmure has a soft heart, but an even softer head. Utherydes tells her that Robb commanded she be sent on to the Twins when she arrived, but she says she is staying. She asks Edmure of his battle plans, and he says they will talk in the godswood. He tells her that he will have eight thousand foot and three thousand horse when all his might is gathered. He plans to guard the fords to prevent Tywin crossing. At the same time, he will have Roose and his ten thousand, augmented by Ser Helman's garrison that Edmure recalled from the Twins, retake Harrenhal, leaving Tywin trapped between two armies, three when Robb returns. Catelyn is not comfortable that Edmure recalled the garrison at the Twins, which was there to insure Lord Walder's loyalty, but Edmure says that he has already proved it many times over and that Stevron died for Robb, Ser Ryman Frey and Black Walder Frey are fighting in Robb's army in the west, Robb is going to marry one of Walder's brood, and Lord Roose has already done so.2 He is confident the plan will work, but Catelyn thinks it would be wiser to just let him through.3 She goes to see Lord Hoster, who is confused. He thinks she is Lysa before her wedding. He tells her that marrying Jon is for the best and that she should never mention that ""wretched stripling"" again. Catelyn wonders who Hoster could be referring to, and thinks it must be a hedge knight or a singer or some other low-born individual.4 Maester Vyman comes and gives Hoster some medicine to make him sleep. He says the end will come soon. When she arrives at her quarters, Utherydes is waiting with two silent sisters. He takes her to see Eddard's bones, which Ser Cleos brought back with him. She orders them taken north to Winterfell. Hallis will lead the escort.","Daenerys rides in a palanquin with Rhaegal and Xaro as Jhogo clears a path. She has just spoken to the Pureborn of Qarth, who has refused her plea for aid in retaking Westeros. They never meant to help her; they only came because they were curious. Aggo and Rakharo are also guarding her. Many people had come to see her dragons and brought gifts that she used to bribe three members of the Pureborn, Egon Emeros, Mathos Mallarawan, and Wendello Qar Deeth. She sold everything she had received except for a crown given to her by the Tourmaline Brotherhood. She will not sell it because Viserys was known as the begger king after selling his mother's crown. She tries once again to convince Xaro to help, but as ever, he will not. The palanquin stops suddenly. Jhogo tells her a performing firemage is the cause. Daenerys wants to see, and Jhogo helps her out. He also points out a cutpurse working the crowd. When the show is over, Quaithe approaches. She says that the firemage could do almost nothing half a year ago, but his powers are growing because of Daenerys's dragons.1 Quaithe says Daenerys must leave Qarth soon. Daenerys asks where she should go, and Quaithe responds, ""To go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward you must go back, and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow."" Daenerys realizes Quaithe wants her to go to Asshai. Daenerys asks what Asshai has that Qarth does not, and Quaithe says that Asshai has truth. They return to Xaro's palace, and Daenerys feeds Rhaegal, Viserion, and Drogon. They are twice the size they were in Vaes Tolorro, but still not big enough for her needs. Jorah comes to see Daenerys. He says they should leave soon and go east. She disagrees and thinks they should return west. Jorah argues that, even if Illyrio were to hire sellswords for her, landing on Westeros with a foreign army would not be a good way to win over her people. She finally decides that her comet led her to Qarth for a reason and that she must see the warlocks.","Tyrion watches from King Robert's Hammer as Myrcella bids farewell to Joffrey and Tommen on Seaswift. Rob's Hammer will be the lead ship in her escort that will also include Lionstar, Bold Wind, and Lady Lyanna. Once Myrcella has reached Braavos, Doran will move his banners north in a feint to make the Marcher lords and Stannis uneasy. He refuses to actually give battle unless Dorne is attacked. The Braavosi will see Myrcella the rest of the way to Dorne. Tyrion feels that Stannis would not risk the wrath of the most powerful of the Free Cities just to seize Myrcella and that she will be safer that way. Ser Arys is going with Myrcella as a sworn shield. The High Septon blesses Myrcella, and then the ships prepare to sail. Bronn escorts Tyrion off the ship and to Cersei, who is attended by Lancel. Lancel has informed Tyrion that Cersei has engaged the services of a hedge knight named Osmund Kettleblack and his brothers Osney and Osfryd to hire a force of sellswords for her to counter Tyrion. Bronn is paying the three brothers to charm her and make promises to her but never actually deliver.1 As the ships disappear from sight, Cersei orders the party back to the Red Keep. Ser Jacelyn leads the way, with Ser Balon and Ser Aron carrying the king's banners behind him. Joffrey and Sansa come next, flanked by Sandor and Ser Mandon; followed by Tommen and Ser Preston; then Cersei, Lancel, Ser Meryn, Ser Boros, and Tyrion; then the High Septon. Behind him is a stream of courtiers, including Ser Horas, Lady Tanda, Lollys, Lord Gyles and Jalabhar Xho.
The crowd is sullen on either side as they pass by. At one point, a woman steps out in front of the party with her dead baby. She starts calling Cersei a brotherfucker, and someone throws dung at Joffrey. Furious, he calls upon Sandor to find the culprit. The crowd gets restless and starts taunting. Soon, they are shouting for bread and surging forward. Tyrion gallops through the crowd and makes it back to the castle. Joffrey also makes it, as do Bronn, Ser Mandon, Cersei, Tommen, Ser Lancel, Ser Meryn, Ser Boros, Ser Balon, Ser Horas, Tanda, Lord Gyles, and Jalabhar. Furious with Joffrey, Tyrion hits him and kicks him for his stupidity. Sansa is not in the castle. Tyrion demands that the Kingsguard go back and find her, as Jaime is as good as dead if she is harmed. He insults Ser Boros, who nearly attacks him, when Sandor rides in with Sansa. She has minor wounds, and Maester Frenken comes forward to tend to her. Sandor says that Ser Aron was held down by four men who took turns hitting his head with a cobblestone. Someone yells that Flea Bottom is on fire. Tyrion orders Bronn to take as many men as necessary to guard the water wagons and make sure the fire is put out; Flea Bottom is expendable, but the fire must not be allowed to spread beyond that area. He tells Sandor to go too, and he grudgingly agrees. Tyrion sees fear in his eyes for an instant and realizes that Sandor is absolutely terrified of fire. He tells Ser Meryn, Ser Boros and Ser Mandon to each take a herald in a different direction and tell people to return to their homes. Ser Meryn refuses, but Cersei lambastes him and forces compliance. Tyrion next wakes Shagga and orders him to guard Shae.
By nightfall, the fires are out and most of the mobs dispersed. Ser Jacelyn comes to Tyrion and gives the final tally. The High Septon was ripped apart by the mob, while Ser Preston was hacked and stabbed to death, and Ser Aron had his head bashed in. Lollys was gang raped, and both Tyrek and the High Septon's crown are missing. Nine gold cloaks were killed and over forty wounded. Tyrion orders Tyrek found immediately, as he is the son of Tyrion's late uncle Tygett, who was always kind to him. Ser Jacelyn warns that the whole city is turning against the Lannisters in general and Tyrion in particular. They do not blame Joffrey for their ills, as he is only a boy, but rather his councilors. Tyrion is misshapen and ugly, and many of his acts, such as dismissing Janos and Pycelle from the small council are rumored to have sinister motives. Tyrion is disheartened that despite all the good he has tried to do he is so reviled. After Ser Jacelyn leaves, Tyrion has Podrick summon Bronn and Varys. Bronn suggests killing Joffrey so the more pliable Tommen will ascend to the throne, but Tyrion refuses to contemplate the murder of his own kin. The three men get down to the business of trying to recover from the mess of the riot.","Davos rides with Stannis and a large group of lords to treat with Ser Cortnay, who awaits them beneath the walls of Storm's End. Davos arrived just eight days ago, after the siege was already well underway. He tried to see Stannis, but has not been allowed until now. Devan told him that the king has had horrible nightmares since Renly's death. Davos thinks Stannis looks years older than he did on Dragonstone.1 Only Melisandre has been able to soothe him to sleep, and she now shares his tent. Ser Cortnay addresses the crowd, which includes Lord Alester Florent, Lord Eldon Estermont, Lady Shyra Errol, Lord Steffon Varner, Lord Bryce Caron, Ser Jon Fossoway, Ser Bryan Fossoway, Ser Guyard Morrigen, and Melisandre. Stannis has given Ser Cortnay a fortnight to consider his terms, which are that the garrison will be pardoned if the castle is surrendered and Edric Storm handed over. Ser Cortnay once again refuses because he does not want to hand over the boy. He offers an alternative to decide the fate of the castle: single combat between him and Stannis or between appointed champions. Stannis refuses, and Ser Cortnay departs.
On the way back to his camp, Stannis consults with Davos. He asks for the former smuggler's frank opinions, and Davos says that all the lords that were with Renly are inconstant and not to be trusted. Stannis agrees and says that he has forgiven but not forgotten. He asks Davos about his mission, and Davos says that he is not sure the tale of incest was believed, particularly since the rumor about Selyse and Patchface had reached many areas before Davos had. Stannis states that he will see justice for Robert, Eddard and Jon. Davos, forgetting himself, asks if he will see justice for Renly as well. Stannis says he dreams of Renly's death sometimes. He says he was abed when it happened and that Devan could not wake him. He says it was only a dream and that he awoke with clean hands. He mentions Renly's peach2 and says he realizes that he loved his brother and will go to his grave thinking of that peach.
They arrive at the camp, and Stannis disperses his lords, telling them to reconvene for a council of war in one hour. Devan holds aside the flap as Stannis and Davos enter the king's tent. Stannis asks Davos's opinion on what to do next. Davos thinks they should sail at once for King's Landing and strike while Tywin is occupied in the west. Stannis disagrees; men only follow him because they fear him, and he cannot be said to be defeated. Furthermore, the castle must fall quickly, as he has other enemies in the south. Prince Doran has fortified the border and there is still the matter of Renly's foot at Bitterbridge. Stannis has sent Ser Erren Florent3 and Ser Parmen Crane to take them in hand, but he has not heard a word and fears that Loras has already taken them for his own.4 Ser Cortnay's second is Lord Elwood Meadows, a boy of twenty who is cousin to the Fossoways. Stannis believes that he would accept his terms and yield the castle if he were in command. Davos is confused, since Ser Cortnay seems healthy. Stannis responds that Ser Cortnay will be dead within the day; Melisandre has seen it in the flames. She saw Renly's death as well and said that if Stannis sailed to Storm's End, he would win the better part of Renly's host, and she was right. Moreover, she saw another possible future where Renly rides out of the south in his green armor and crushes Stannis's army before the walls of King's Landing, so Stannis needed to deal with Renly to forestall his own defeat.5 Stannis orders Davos to navigate a boat to Storm's End. Davos realizes he is to take part in an assassination, and asks why he does not just let Ser Cortnay keep the boy. Stannis replies that Melisandre has also seen in the flames that he needs Edric.
That night, Davos rows Melisandre across Shipbreaker Bay. He asks Melisandre about Renly and realizes she killed him. She says she needs Davos's help now because Storm's End is warded with ancient spells that no shadow can pass. Davos takes them into a cave under the walls and halts. Melisandre throws back the cloak she is wearing to reveal that she is pregnant. She squats and births a shadow that quickly disappears. Davos realizes with horror that the shadow looks like Stannis.","Jon is awakened by the blowing of a horn. He attends Lord Commander Mormont, who says Qhorin must have finally arrived and tells Jon to meet with him and send him to the Lord Commander's tent. Qhorin had been expected days ago, and his failure to arrive had caused some dissension among the leadership. Ser Ottyn wanted to return to Castle Black, while Ser Mallador thought they should head towards the Shadow Tower and find Qhorin's trail. Thoren wanted to attack Mance, arguing that the professionals of the Watch would roll right over the rabble despite the disparity in numbers, though others pointed out that Mance has several competent commanders, including Rattleshirt, Alfyn Crowkiller, and Harma Dogshead. Despite hours of argument, no decision was reached and it was decided to keep waiting a few more days. Jon gets Dolorous Edd and Hake started on preparing food for the new arrivals and then goes to find Qhorin. He runs into Sam on the way and tells him what is happening. As the men from the Shadow Tower ride in, Jon can tell they had trouble on the way.
Jon meets Qhorin and takes him to the Lord Commander. Qhorin reports that he encountered Alfyn Crowkiller, whom Mance had sent to scout the Wall. Alfyn was killed along with most of his men, but some escaped. Qhorin lost four men and a dozen were wounded. Lord Commander Mormont and Qhorin go into the Lord Commander's tent to talk. Jon is worried about morale. Last night, he chanced upon several black brothers, including Chett and Lark, talking. They do not want to fight the wildlings, and Chett hinted that they may act if Mormont tries to make them fight.1 He left quickly after being noticed, fingering his new dragonglass dagger. He had made three daggers from the cache of dragonglass discovered by Ghost, giving the other two to Grenn and the Lord Commander. The old horn in the cache he gave to Sam. Jon attends the Lord Commander as he and Qhorin contemplate what to do next. Qhorin reports that Mance's host is large, with Rattleshirt, the Weeper, and all the other chiefs great and small assembled in an army including wargs and mammoths. They discuss manning some of the abandoned castles along the Wall such as Greyguard, Long Barrow, and Stonedoor and increasing patrols. Qhorin reports that his man Ebben interrogated a captive that told him Mance is in the Frostfangs looking for some magic that will breach the Wall.2 Qhorin says they must find out what it is. He proposes three patrols to go into the mountains, led by Jarmen, Thoren, and himself. Mormont agrees. Qhorin says he wants Jon to be part of his group, and the Lord Commander gives his assent.","Tyrion meets with Lancel in the sept and is informed that Cersei is having Lord Gyles take Tommen to Rosby in disguise to keep him away from the mob and Tyrion. After the meeting, Tyrion gives Bronn a letter for Ser Jacelyn telling him to take fifty men to scout the roseroad. It is a cover; he tells Bronn the real orders, which are to lie in wait for Lord Gyles's party, seize Tommen, and take him on to Rosby so he will be safe and in Tyrion's control. Tyrion rides with Bronn part of the way and then on toward Chataya's. The streets are empty due to a new extended curfew, of which the punishment for violation is death. While the curfew has helped keep the mobs in check and cut down on murders, the people hate Tyrion for it. He becomes impatient and decides to go directly to Shae's manse. When he arrives, he hears singing. As he enters, the singer introduces himself as Symon Silver Tongue. He recognizes Tyrion, and Tyrion threatens him so he will not tell anyone of Shae. He goes upstairs with Shae and says she may keep the singer, but he must be kept under close watch. They have sex and Tyrion goes outside.
Varys, dressed as a filthy beggar, comes to see Tyrion. Shae is able to recognize him, which shocks both the eunuch and Tyrion. Varys reports that Cortnay Penrose is dead and Storm's End now belongs to Stannis. Tyrion tells Varys he will ride back to the castle with him. He tells Shae that he wants to move her there too, disguised as a scullion, but Shae does not like that idea one bit. Tyrion is fearful for her safety and does his best to convince her, even telling her about his previous marriage to Tysha, and she finally accepts. On the way back to the castle, Tyrion tells Varys about his plan for Shae, but Varys thinks there would be too many questions and suggests an alternative. Lollys's servant has been filching her jewels; if Varys were to tell Lady Tanda that would create an opening for Shae, conveniently close should Tyrion have need of her. Tyrion replies that she would not be able to visit him at the Tower of the Hand unseen, and Varys reveals that there is a secret access to Tyrion's chambers. The conversation returns to Ser Cortnay. It is reported that he threw himself off a tower, but Varys does not think that makes any sense. He tells Tyrion he believes it was magic.1 Tyrion scoffs at the idea, so Varys tells him about his childhood.
Varys had been an orphan boy with a traveling folly that performed in all the Free Cities and also in King's Landing and Oldtown. One time when the troupe was in Myr, a man made an offer for Varys that his master could not refuse. The man cut off Varys's manly parts and used them as part of a spell. Varys, drugged and in pain, heard a vocal answer from whatever the man had conjured. He has hated magic and all those who practice it ever since. Afterwards, he was thrown out on the street and became a thief, eventually one of the best in Myr. Varys warns that Lord Tywin may be trapped between enemies. Oakheart and Rowan forces have been spotted north of the Mander, while Randyll Tarly has taken Renly's stores at Bitterbridge and put many to the sword, mostly Florents. Lord Caswell has locked himself in his castle. Tyrion relishes the irony that he is the only one standing between Stannis and chaos.","Catelyn and Brienne see Ser Edmure off as he leads his men out of Riverrun to do battle with Lord Tywin. He has left only a small garrison of the young, old, and wounded, led by Ser Desmond, to defend the castle. Brienne asks what they must do now, and Catelyn responds that they will do their duty. Catelyn has always done her duty, which may be why she was Lord Hoster's favorite child. Since her two older brothers had died in infancy, Catelyn was a son and a daughter to him until Edmure was born. She was forced to become lady of Riverrun at an early age when her mother died, snubbed Petyr when she was promised to marry Brandon Stark, and married Eddard without complaint after Brandon died. Catelyn ends up praying in the sept for hours. She thinks of some of her mentors, such as Septon Osmynd, Lord Hoster, Ser Brynden, and Maester Kym, and how they always seemed to know everything, and laments that for the first time in her life she is unsure of her duty. When she emerges, she sees Rymund singing a song about war. Brienne stops to listen and wishes she were fighting in the battle. Later that day, Maester Vyman receives a raven from Lord Elwood stating that Ser Cortnay is dead and that Storm's End has declared for Stannis. Catelyn says that Robb should be told of this and asks where he is. Vyman responds that he was marching for the Crag, the seat of House Westerling, at last report. Ser Desmond's squire comes to report that Lannisters have reached the river. Catelyn goes to the battlements to join Ser Desmond and sees about fifty Lannister scouts flying the purple unicorn of House Brax. The fords, as well as three others, are held by Mallister men. After a brief skirmish, the Lannisters withdraw. There is another attempt at the ford late that night, but it is held again. Brienne says that Tywin is probing for a weakness and will try to force a crossing if he cannot find one.
The next morning, Catelyn tells Utherydes to send wine to Ser Cleos to loosen him up for questioning later. Soon after, a rider comes with a message from Lord Jason. Ser Flement tried to force a crossing at another ford but was turned aside with heavy losses. Lord Karyl also repulsed another attack even further upstream. That evening she visits Ser Cleos and asks him about the peace terms he brought. Catelyn is particularly interested in Tyrion's promise to exchange Arya and Sansa for Jaime. She asks after her daughters and discovers that Cleos never saw Arya.
Five days later, Catelyn learns that Tywin launched his major assault two days before. He tried to force a crossing at a dozen different fords. Lord Leo Lefford drowned and Ser Lyle Crakehall, known as Strongboar, was captured. Ser Addam made three attempts at one ford, but was finally forced to retreat. At Stone Mill, Ser Gregor led the fiercest assault, and a few of his men briefly gained the other side, but the reserves were committed, and he was forced to withdraw. Lord Tywin is now moving southeast and appears to be in retreat. A great celebration is held that night, but Catelyn is worried. She consults a map and sees that if Tywin is heading southeast, he has probably already reached the headwaters of the Blackwater.","Bran is inside Summer and hears strange noises in the night. He howls to raise the alarm, but no one hears. Shaggydog comes up; he has smelled it too. There are foes in the night. Summer hurls himself against the gates, but they will not budge. Bran gives him the thought of climbing one of the tall trees. Summer tries it, but falls, and Bran wakes up. He calls for his guards before remembering that no one is there. Ser Rodrik took most of the men from the castle and the nearby holdfasts eight days ago. All told, he has six hundred men and will be joined by three hundred more led by Cley Cerwyn. They are marching to relieve Torrhen's Square, which is besieged by Dagmer. Maester Luwin has been sending ravens to summon more men from White Harbor, the barrowlands, and the wolfswood. Werlag comes into Bran's room, followed by Theon, who informs Bran that he has taken Winterfell. He sent four men over the walls, and they opened a postern gate to let the others in. He tells Bran that he will bring everyone to the Great Hall, where Bran will yield the castle to him, and then leaves. Maester Luwin arrives after a while. He says that Alebelly was killed and Hayhead wounded. He got two birds off before he was taken. The one to White Harbor got away, but the other was shot down. He tells Bran he must protect his smallfolk and yield the castle. Lorren comes to get him, and they are joined on the way to the Great Hall by Rickon, Meera, Jojen, Little Walder, and Big Walder. When they arrive, Theon is sitting in the high seat. Others that have been herded in include Old Nan, Hayhead, Poxy Tym, Beth, Gage, Osha, Mikken, Farlen, Palla, Septon Chayle, and Hodor. Reek is brought in last of all.1 As Theon begins to speak, Mikken continually insults him until Stygg finally kills him. Hodor starts bellowing, and Theon has his men beat the stableboy bloody. Reek speaks up and says Theon will need men, and Theon accepts him into his service. Osha speaks up as well, saying she resents being in the kitchens and wants to fight again. After she disarms Stygg, Theon agrees to take her as well. Theon dismisses the assembled crowd after that, and Hodor takes Bran back to his room.","Arya is talking to Hot Pie in the kitchens when she hears two horn blasts and the front gate opening. It is the first time the gate has opened since Tywin left. Arya goes to see what is happening. Vargo Hoat and the Brave Companions have returned with plunder and prisoners. Ser Amory comes out and demands to know what is going on. Vargo says that Lord Roose had tried to cross the river, but the Brave Companions routed his van. The captives include the commander of the van, Robett and Ser Aenys Frey. Ser Amory tells Ser Cadwyn to take them to the dungeon. Arya notices Pinkeye, her new boss with Weese's death, and decides to slip off before she is seen. She passes the armory and sees Gendry, who asks what is going on. Arya asks him to help her aid the northmen in escaping, but he refuses. He says that one of the smiths, Ben Blackthumb, has smithed at Harrenhal for three generations of Whents and has said who is master of the castle is not important. He means to stay on. She runs to the godswood, where she has hidden a broken broom handle she uses to do the exercises Syrio taught her. After a while, she prays before the heart tree. Afterwards, Jaqen makes his presence known. He is weary of waiting and wants a third name. He also reveals that he knows she is Arya Stark. She asks him to help her free the northmen, but he says he will only kill the one person. She finally names Jaqen. Shocked and distraught, Jaqen tries to get her to take it back, but she will not unless he helps free the northmen. He reluctantly agrees, calling her an evil child, and says they will do so immediately.
Jaqen sends Arya to the kitchen to get broth and says he will come shortly. She goes and orders the cook to make the broth. He sends her to fetch Pia to serve the Brave Companions, which she does and then returns. After a while, Jaqen comes with Rorge and Biter. They take several cauldrons of broth to the dungeons, where they hurl them at the guards before killing them. After they open the gates, Robett introduces himself and asks if they are with the Brave Companions; apparently Vargo was going to betray Harrenhal to Roose. Rorge laughs and says they are now. The northmen quickly fan out to take control of the castle, and Arya and Jaqen are left alone. Arya takes back his name, and Jaqen passes a hand before his face. When he is done, he has fuller cheeks, eyes that are closer together, a hooked nose, a scar on his right cheek, and a tight cap of dark curls.1 An astonished Arya asks how he did it and whether he can teach her. Jaqen says she must come with him across the narrow sea to learn. She is still intent on getting to Winterfell, so he gives her an iron coin instead. He tells her that if she ever wants to find him again she should show the coin to any Braavosi and say the words valar morghulis. After Jaqen leaves, she returns to bed.
The next morning, Pinkeye tells the servants that Harrenhal has fallen and the new lord will be there before evening. When Roose arrives, he confers with Robett and Ser Aenys, and then speaks to Rorge and Biter. At that moment, one of the Brave Companions, Shagwell the Fool, grabs Arya and brings her forward, saying that she is the one responsible for the soup. Lord Roose regards her and asks a few questions, including her name. She says it is Nymeria, though Nan for short. He decides to make her his cupbearer for as long as he is at Harrenhal. That evening, she attends him and Vargo as Ser Amory is fed to a bear.","Daenerys stands before the House of the Undying Ones, which appears no more than a ruin. Drogon is on her shoulder. Most of those with her, Jhogo, Ser Jorah, Xaro, and Aggo, tell her she should turn back, but she will not. Pyat Pree comes up to take her to the building. As they near the entrance, Pyat gives her some instructions. She must always take the door to her right, and if she comes to any stairs she must go up. Within other rooms she will see visions of the past and future, and some may speak to her as she goes, but she must keep her path until she reaches the Undying themselves. At the door, a dwarf gives her a glass of shade of the evening to prepare her for the truths within. She enters with Drogon. As she goes through room after room, she begins to see visions through some of the open doors on her left. In one, a woman is being worked over by four little men with rat-like faces. In another, she sees a multitude of slaughtered feasters, above whom sits a dead king with the head of a wolf.1 In the next room, Ser Willem beckons her to the house with the red door. Another door near the end of the hall reveals an old man with dark eyes and long, silver-grey hair on a barbed throne proclaiming to a man at the foot, ""Let him be king over charred bones and cooked meat. Let him be the king of ashes.""2 After several more doors, she sees a man that looks like Viserys, but taller and with eyes of a darker purple.3 He turns to a woman nursing a babe and names the child Aegon. The woman asks if he will write a song, and the man replies, ""He has a song. He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire."" He turns to Daenerys then, and almost seems to see her before adding, ""There must be one more. The dragon has three heads.""4
At the end of a hall, Daenerys finds no door on her right and sees the torches going out behind her. She suddenly realizes that the last door on the left is also the first door on the right, and she steps through. After several more rooms, an apparition of Pyat tries to lure her left, but she is not fooled. At the top of a staircase, she opens a door and sees a beautiful room full of people with perfect features. One of them says they are the Undying and bids her to enter. Drogon recoils and Daenerys realizes there is actually a narrow door to the right. She flees and passes through this one instead. She enters a gloomy room dominated by a long stone table above which floats a human heart, blue and corrupt. A voice hails her as ""mother of dragons"". She can make out the Undying at the table. They are old, wizened, and blue. They appear dead, but just as she thinks that, the voice calls again and says they live. They call her ""child of three"" and give several foretellings based on that theme. They say she will light three fires, ""one for life and one for death and one to love.""5 They say she will ride three mounts, ""one to bed and one to dread and one to love.""6 Finally, they say that she will know three treasons, ""once for blood and once for gold and once for love.""7 Next, a series of visions comes to her faster and faster: Viserys covered in molten gold; her stillborn son Rhaego as a man with a burning city behind him; Rhaegar dying on the Trident; Stannis holding aloft a flaming sword but casting no shadow; a cloth dragon swaying on poles amidst a cheering crowd; a great stone beast taking wing from a smoking tower; her silver riding towards a stream beneath a sea of stars; a corpse with bright eyes and gray lips smiling sadly on the prow of a ship; a blue flower growing in a chink of ice;8 Mirri Maz Duur performing her shadow magic; a young Daenerys outside the house with the red door; Mirri Maz Duur dying as Daenerys's dragons hatch; a bloody corpse, naked, bound and dragged behind her silver; a white lion, taller than a man, running through grass;9 a line of naked crones coming out of a great lake and kneeling before her;10 and ten thousand slaves reaching out to touch her and crying ""mother"" as she rides past.11 Suddenly, Daenerys realizes that the Undying are all around her, touching, clawing, and biting. She cannot move. Drogon belches forth flame and soon the whole room is ablaze. Daenerys runs out of the room and down a long hallway that finally ends in a door leading outside. Pyat Pree is there gibbering in a strange tongue. He lunges at her with a knife, but Drogon flies at his face. Jhogo and Rakharo subdue him as Ser Jorah comes to Daenerys's aid.","Tyrion sees Shagga and his Stone Crows off. The Burned Men left two days ago, followed by the Moon Brothers and the Black Ears. Tyrion is sending them into the kingswood to raid and harry Stannis's army. He warns Shagga that fighting Stannis' men will be different from fighting Milk Snakes or Painted Dogs in the mountains and reminds him to make good use of the guides Tyrion has provided. Tyrion is uneasy without his clansmen. He has eight hundred sellswords, but cannot trust their loyalty. He has promised Bronn and a dozen others knighthoods after the battle, but he knows they will not die for a knighthood. The City Watch now numbers six thousand men, but only a quarter are reliable. The Watch was only two thousand strong in Robert's day. Only three hundred knights, squires, and men-at-arms are in the city. Tyrion returns to Bronn and his escort. He gazes over the structures that have grown up against the city walls and orders Bronn to take a hundred men and burn everything from the river to the walls so Stannis will not have materials to build siegecraft. He rides back into the city and past three giant trebuchets in the market square. The men have named them the Three Whores because they are to give Stannis a lusty welcome.
Back in his audience chamber, Tyrion deals with several trader captains complaining about seized ships and then rushes to the investiture for the two new Kingsguard, at which they are to be anointed by the new High Septon and King Joffrey. Ser Balon is replacing Ser Preston, while Ser Osmund is replacing Ser Boros, despite the fact that he is a lowly hedge knight. When Ser Jacelyn intercepted Tommen's party on its way to Rosby, Ser Boros had given up the prince without any struggle at all, despite his vows to die to protect the royal family. A furious Cersei made Joffrey strip him of his white cloak, and he is now being held in the dungeon of Rosby. Tyrion sees Lady Tanda there, but not Lollys, which disappoints him as he had hoped to see Shae, who is now her servant as planned. Joffrey leaves with his new Kingsguard and Tyrion confers with the High Septon, whom he handpicked. He tells the man to spread the word that Stannis means to burn the Great Sept of Baelor and that anyone who joins him is betraying the gods. He also mentions that Stannis burned the godswood at Storm's End.
When Tyrion returns to his solar, Hallyne is waiting, as are messages brought by Maester Frenken. One is an old one from Prince Doran Martell telling of Storm's End's fall, but the other is from Balon Greyjoy, styling himself King of the Isles and the North, inviting Joffrey to send an envoy to fix the borders of their realms and work out a possible alliance. Tyrion is unsure of what to do with that bit of information. He admits Hallyne, who tells him there are thirteen thousand jars of wildfire ready. Tyrion thinks he is lying, but Hallyne claims that the spells are working better. He asks if there are any dragons in the world again, for Wisdom Pollitor told him long ago that magic started to go out of the world when the last dragon died.1 The newly-made Lord Jacelyn of Rosby comes in next. He has returned from the castle with a few more levies. He reports that Tommen is safe and that plans have been made to spirit him away if necessary. Finally, Varys comes to report a new conspiracy. A group of traders, merchants, and craftsmen calling itself the Antler Men has armed several hundred followers to seize the Old Gate and admit Stannis after the fighting begins. They believe he will win and want to share in the reward. One of them is Salloreon. Tyrion orders their arrest.","Theon awakes in the dead of night next to Kyra, whom he has brought to Winterfell to please him. He has a sense that something is wrong, but cannot put his finger on it. Suddenly, he realizes that the constant howling of the direwolves has stopped. He sends Urzen to see what is happening and wakes Wex to make sure Bran and Rickon are where they are supposed to be. Wex and Urzen report that Bran, Rickon, Summer, and Shaggydog are gone. He tells them to rouse the castle and have Lorren check the gates. He hopes Stygg reaches Asha soon; he is worried he does not have enough men. The people of the castle resent him. Palla was raped, and even though he beat the men that did it, he was blamed. They are also angry that he gave Septon Chayle to the Drowned God by throwing him down a well. Lorren brings Theon to the Hunter's Gate, where he sees that the guards, Drennan and Squint, are missing. They soon find them dead. Theon decides they cannot go after the boys until morning.
Theon goes to address his assembled subjects. Reek1 tells him that Jojen, Meera, Hodor, and Osha are also missing. Aggar said that all the horses are accounted for, so the party is on foot. Theon addresses the crowd, which includes Gage, Nan, Joseth, Farlen, and Barth, the brewer's wife and the first woman he ever had sex with, and demands to know where the boys are and who helped them. The crowd is silent. Theon orders Joseth to saddle Smiler and a horse for himself. Murch, Gariss, Poxy Tym, Aggar, Gynir Rednose, Gelmarr, Reek, Wex, Farlen, and Maester Luwin will also accompany him on the hunt. Little Walder asks to come as well, despite Big Walder's voiced disdain, and Theon gives permission. Lorren is in charge until Theon returns. They head out at dawn and follow the trail to a stream before losing it. Wex, through gestures, is able to point out that the tracks have all disappeared save for those of the direwolves. He splits his party into three groups to try and relocate the trail, but they cannot do so. After searching until evening, he realizes with horror that he will not find them. Reek speaks up and says that he thinks they are at a nearby mill. He shows Theon some things he is carrying in a sack, and Theon suddenly agrees.2 He sends everyone back save Gelmarr, Aggar, Rednose, and Reek and heads for the mill.","Qhorin's scouting party, consisting of Jon, Squire Dalbridge, Ebben, Qhorin, and Stonesnake, are navigating the Skirling Pass. Above they see the fire of wildling sentries. Stonesnake and Jon prepare to climb up to take care of them. Jon leaves Ghost behind with the others. After a long and difficult climb, they end up above the wildlings. There are three of them. One is feeding the fire, another is watching the pass, and a third is asleep. Stonesnake and Jon each mark their man and leap into action. They kill their targets as the third wildling stirs.1 Jon loses Longclaw in the fight, so he lunges quickly at the other wildling and realizes she is a woman. Instead of killing her, he forces her to yield and takes her prisoner over Stonesnake's objections. She gives her name as Ygritte. Stonesnake interrogates her some, and when she learns that Jon is a Stark bastard, she tells him Bael the Bard's song of the winter rose. Before becoming King-beyond-the-Wall, Bael was a feared raider. The Stark in Winterfell at the time wanted his head, but could never find him and so called him a craven. In response, Bael brought his harp to Winterfell and he played and sang so beautifully that he was allowed to name his own reward. Bael wanted only the most beautiful winter rose in Winterfell's gardens, which he received. The next morning, the singer and the lord's maiden daughter had vanished, with only the pale blue rose on the maiden's bed. No sign of them was found for almost a year, until one night the maid was back in her room with a babe at her breast. She had fallen in love with Bael and had borne him a son while they hid in the castle's crypts. The song ends there, but the story does not end until thirty years later when Bael as King-beyond-the-Wall led his people south to breach the Wall, but was slain by the young Lord Stark that was his son. The young Stark's mother threw herself from a tower in grief when she saw Bael's head mounted on a spear, and the young lord was soon after flayed by one of his own lords who wore his skin as a cloak.2 The next day the rest of the group meets up with Stonesnake and Jon. When they see Ygritte, they say she must die. Since she yielded to Jon, Qhorin tells him to do what must be done, and he leaves with the others since it will be easier for Jon if they do not watch. Jon lets Ygritte go.","Sansa is in the godswood talking to Dontos. There are fires everywhere outside the city. Stannis has burned much of the kingswood trying to ferret out the clansmen, while Tyrion has burned all the buildings outside the city walls. Lord Stannis is still on his way, but his vanguard has arrived. The royal fleet has been trading shots with Stannis's men. Ser Guyard commands the vanguard, which is three thousand strong. Dontos tells her that a ship will come to take her away soon. Sansa leaves, but instead of going back to her room, she goes up to the roof to look over the city. She feels a sudden stab of pain and fear and nearly falls, but Sandor moves out of the shadows to catch her. Sansa thinks back to how Sandor saved her from the mob and tries to thank him, but he is bitter and full of anger. He talks of his pleasure for killing. Sansa asks if he is afraid of the coming battle and of dying and being sent to some hell by the gods. Sandor denies the gods and says that the world is cruel and there are no true knights. Sansa cannot bear to hear any more and leaves. That night, she dreams of the mob again, and awakes the next morning covered in blood; her first period has begun. Frantic, she tries to wash off the blood and hide the event so she will not be married to Joffrey. She starts trying to burn her sheets and even her bed to hide the stains when three servants stop her. They bathe and dress her and take her to Cersei, who talks of her own marriage and the birthing of her children. Robert would always go hunting when her time was near. She tells Sansa that she knows it will be hard being married to Joffrey, but that she will love her children. Cersei says Robert always wanted to be loved, as does Tyrion. As far as she is concerned, love is fatal.","Qhorin, Dalbridge, Stonesnake, Ebben, Jon, and Ghost continue through the Skirling Pass. While they are stopped to rest, Jon and Qhorin discuss Mance Rayder and Jon's encounter with Ygritte. Qhorin was friends with Mance, whom he considered one of the Watch's best rangers, but he lacked discipline. Jon asks why Mance deserted and Qhorin says that he was born a wildling, taken as a child, and never learned how to obey. Jon reveals to Qhorin that he let Ygritte go. Qhorin is not surprised. He says he did not need her dead and saw it as an opportunity to learn more about Jon. Jon goes to sleep and dreams that he is Ghost. He sees his brother's face in a weirwood, but with three eyes, which he says he did not have before the crow. Jon smells death, but his brother says he does not mind the dark and tries to open Ghost's eyes too.1 Suddenly, still in Ghost, he is on a precipice and sees the wildling camp spread out below him. They are a disorganized rabble, but he sees mammoths with giants riding on their backs. An eagle2 attacks from the sky, and Jon wakes up screaming. He relates everything to Qhorin. The rangers are unsure what to think, and they spy an eagle above, but Qhorin decides to press on. Just then Jon spots Ghost, injured but alive. After they patch him up, Qhorin says they shall go back; the eagle has seen them, and they will be pursued. When they arrive at the spot where they killed the wildling sentries, Qhorin orders Dalbridge to stay behind to hold off the pursuers. As the rest continue, they hear horns behind them.","Podrick dresses Tyrion for dinner with Cersei. On the way to her chambers, Varys gives him a scroll reporting the deaths of Bran and Rickon.1 Tyrion says he will tell Cersei. He gives Cersei the note, and they prepare to eat. There is still no word from Bitterbridge. Cersei thinks Petyr might have betrayed them to Stannis, but Tyrion points out that those two would not get on well at all. Lady Tanda has asked leave to return to Stokeworth; she will be refused. The talk turns to the clanmsen, then Antler Men, then Varys, and finally Sandor. Varys told Cersei that Tyrion means for Sandor to lead sorties rather than guard the king. Tyrion says he needs both him and Ser Balon, and that Ser Osmund and Ser Meryn can guard the king. He says Joffrey must be seen on the walls so his men will fight more fiercely. He will not take part in the fighting and will be well guarded. Tyrion says he will release Lord Gyles as well, as a gesture of good faith. Cersei starts to become more threatening, and finally reveals that she has Tyrion's whore. She is sick of his scheming and accuses him of trying to get Joffrey killed so he can rule through Tommen. She does not plan to kill him though, as Jaime would never forgive her. Instead, she will hold his whore hostage. Cersei has Osney and Osfryd bring her in. To Tyrion's relief, it is Alayaya and not Shae; Cersei fell for the decoy. Tyrion plays along and acts concerned, and Cersei says she will be exchanged for Tommen after the battle so long as no harm comes to Joffrey. Tyrion threatens to harm Tommen if anything happens to Alayaya, and Cersei tries to slap him but Tyrion grabs her wrist and shoves her to the floor. He says he will make her pay for this, that a day will come when she thinks she is safe and happy and he will turn her joy to ashes in her mouth. He leaves then and returns to his chambers, where he is surprised to find Shae waiting for him. Varys brought her through some hidden passages. She was blindfolded, but she is able to describe one portion of the passage where she got a look at a dragon mosaic on the floor. Tyrion searches for the door to the passage, but cannot find it. Shae tries to arouse him, but it is no use. He tells her to go to sleep and then stays up listening to her breathe.","Catelyn and Brienne eat alone in the Great Hall, while outside, the castle celebrates Edmure's victory and Robb's recent capture of the Crag. She has learned that Bran and Rickon are dead.1 Maester Vyman received the word from Ser Rodrik, who is marching to retake Winterfell. Catelyn tells Brienne what happened. She is torn by grief and despair. She talks of her daughters and how she wants to kill Theon and all the Lannisters. Catelyn has sent wine to Jaime and bids Brienne to come with her to the dungeons at midnight. She goes to see Hoster, but he is asleep. She tells Maester Vyman to go join in the celebration and then sits with her father for hours, until Brienne comes to tell her it is midnight. They go to the dungeons, where she leaves Brienne to see that she is not disturbed, and she enters Jaime's cell.
Jaime has not touched the wine. He has not been allowed to shave since his capture, and he has a thick yellow beard and long dirty hair. He is arrogant at first, but just as Catelyn is about to leave, he says he will cooperate. He agrees to tell her what she wants to know in exchange for information on what is happening in Westeros. Jaime admits to fathering Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen and to flinging Bran from a window. Catelyn asks him about the assassination attempt on Bran, and he says the Lannisters are innocent. Catelyn tells him of the dagger and how Tyrion won it from Petyr, but Jaime says that Tyrion never bets against him. He did remember the dagger changing hands though, because Robert showed it to him afterwards as he mocked Jaime.2 He talks of Aerys and Brandon Stark. Brandon was on his way to Riverrun to marry Catelyn when he heard that Lyanna had been taken by Rhaegar. He rode into the Red Keep with Ethan Glover, Jeffory Mallister, Kyle Royce, and Elbert Arryn shouting for Rhaegar to come out and die. Rhaegar was not there, and Aerys had them all arrested for treason. Their fathers were summoned to answer the charges and then executed along with the sons, save for Ethan. Lord Rickard demanded trial by combat, and Aerys granted his request, declaring fire to be the champion of House Targaryen and having Rickard cooked in his armor. Brandon was bound, around his throat a cord attached to a Tyroshi device, and made to watch with his longsword just out of reach. He strangled himself trying to free him. Jaime notes the irony that he is loved by one for a kindness he never did and reviled by so many for his finest act.3 Now well and truly drunk, he begins insulting Catelyn and Eddard. Catelyn calls Brienne and asks for her sword.","Theon is awoken from a bad dream by the arrival of Wex and Reek.1 Reek informs him that Asha has arrived. Theon bathes and dresses and falls in with Reek, Urzen, and Kromm to go see Asha. Winterfell has wanted him dead since the killings at the mill. That very night, Gelmarr the Grim died after falling down some stairs and breaking his back. The next day, they found Aggar with his throat slit. Several days later, Rednose showed up dead too. Theon thought Farlen as likely a suspect as any and needed to make an example, so he executed the kennelmaster. Farlen had remarked that Eddard always did his own killing, forcing Theon to do the deed himself. His first cut missed the neck, and it took three more cuts before the deed was done, leaving Theon sick. In actuality, Theon had Reek kill all three men because he did not believe they would be able to keep secret what happened at the mill. Lorren has told Theon that they should abandon Winterfell, but Theon refuses to be driven from his seat. Asha awaits him in the Great Hall. She taunts Theon about killing Bran and Rickon, causing him to think back on the aftermath. When the bodies were brought back to Winterfell, Old Nan just gaped in shock while Farlen charged Theon and had to be restrained by Urzen and Cadwyl. Maester Luwin asked for leave to sew the heads back onto the bodies and bury them in the crypts, but Theon refused the request, mounting the heads on the wall and burning the bodies.
Asha only brought twenty men with her, of which she only means to leave ten. She is critical of Theon and mocks him some more before telling him they should speak in private. They go to Eddard's solar. Theon tells Asha that the siege of Torrhen's Square was broken. Asha has already heard and tells him that Dagmer is still alive and falling back. Rodrik and Leobald are now coming to retake Winterfell. The Umbers and Manderlys are stirring as well. Asha tells him that if he had razed the castle and brought Bran and Rickon back to Pyke as hostages, he would have performed a masterstroke, but he can never hope to hold a castle isolated from the sea in the middle of a hostile country. Theon still thinks Asha is jealous and trying to strip him of his prize and does not heed her advice to fall back now before it is too late. Asha is especially critical of Theon's murder of the children. Theon makes up a story, that it was to avenge their brothers, Rodrik and Maron, but Asha is not impressed. She leaves. Reek approaches afterwards and says that for a bit of coin he may be able to rouse one or two hundred men for the defense of the castle. All he wants in return is Palla. Theon gives him silver, and he rides off. That night, Theon has another horrible nightmare. He sends for Maester Luwin, who gives him a sleeping draught, but Theon does not trust the maester and does not take it. He summons Kyra and fucks her savagely, but that does not help either. The next morning, he looks up at the heads on the wall. He thinks back to the mill, and how they killed the miller's boys, who were of an age with Bran and Rickon. Reek flayed the skin off their faces and dipped their heads in tar, and everyone assumed they were actually Bran and Rickon.","Sansa listens to the singing in the sept. They have been singing prayers all morning, since Stannis's sails appeared. She is in the yard watching Joffrey arm for battle with Ser Meryn's help. Tyrion, flanked by Ser Mandon, sees her and speaks to her briefly before Joffrey calls her to him. He shows her his new sword, Hearteater, which has a ruby pommel cut in the shape of a heart set between a lion's jaws, and has her kiss the blade. He then rides off to take command of the three whores, flanked by Ser Meryn and Ser Osmund, with Tyrion and Ser Mandon following to the rear. Sansa goes to the sept and sings with the others for a while, but leaves as the septon prepares to ask the gods to bless Joffrey. Outside, she can just make out the sounds of battle over the singing. She makes her way to Maegor's Holdfast, where Cersei is hosting all the noblewomen of the city. She sees Lady Tanda and her daughters on their way in. Falyse has just arrived with a small troop of soldiers from Castle Stokeworth. Lollys, leaning on Shae, is balking at going onto the bridge. She finally has to be dragged. Sansa goes to the Queen's Ballroom, and notices Ser Ilyn there. She asks Osfryd, now the captain of the queen's new guard, which is composed of sellswords, why he is there, and the sellsword says the queen thinks he will be needed. Cersei arrives and the banquet begins.","Davos stands on the deck of Black Betha, in a line with Wraith and Lady Marya on Blackwater Bay. Ser Imry Florent commands the fleet from Fury; Stannis is with his troops on land. Ser Imry sends the order to lower sails; the fleet will proceed by oar so it is less exposed. Davos shouts commands echoed by his son Matthos. The line begins to form, with Pride of Driftmark and Bold Laughter moving into position. Harridan and Seahorse are moving slowly, however, and Swordfish, armed with the largest ram in the fleet, is lagging way behind. Davos is in the starboard wing of the second line. The fleet is organized into ten lines of battle composed of twenty ships each. The first two lines are to smash the small royal fleet, while the remaining ships will land troops to attack the city. The slowest ships will ferry Stannis's army across the Blackwater Rush to attack. Salladhor Saan in his Valyrian and the rest of his ships provide a rear guard out in the bay. The voyage from Storm's End had been slow due to the winds. A storm had scattered the fleet and more than a dozen ships were lost. Stannis is no doubt impatiently awaiting the fleet's arrival on the south bank with twenty thousand men, mostly knights and freeriders. The rest of the line has just about formed now, with Red Claw, Piety, Prayer, and Devotion in place. The first line is centered on Fury and consists of the two-hundred-oar galleys Lord Steffon and Stag of the Sea and the hundred-oar Lady Harra, Brightfish, Laughing Lord, Sea Demon, Horned Honor, Ragged Jenna, Trident Three, Swift Sword, Princess Rhaenys, Dog's Nose, Sceptre, Faithful, Red Raven, Queen Alysanne, Cat, Courageous, and Dragonsbane. After Ser Imry sounds the attack, Davos spies two new towers and a chain boom held between them and wonders why the harbor has not been closed to them. Davos gives the order for battle speed and hears his sons Dale and Allard do the same on their own ships. The fleet enters the Blackwater Rush. Davos sees the royal fleet drawn up before them: Godsgrace, Prince Aemon, Lady of Silk, Lady's Shame, Wildwind, Kingslander, White Hart, Lance, and Seaflower. Davos wonders why some of the bigger ships, such as Lionstar, Lady Lyanna, and King Robert's Hammer are not there and suspects a trap.1
As the fleet maneuvers closer, pitch and arrows begin to rain down from the walls of King's Landing, and Matthos hands Davos his helm. Seeing Stannis's army on the south shore flying the fiery heart makes Davos think of Melisandre. After Storm's End was taken, Stannis shipped Edric Storm to Dragonstone, and his lords insisted that he send Melisandre away as well. Stannis was about to refuse them until Lord Bryce told him that if Melisandre was by his side when he won at King's Landing, men would say he took the city with magic and owes his crown to her. Prayer, Piety, and Devotion begin to land archers under the walls, and a sortie led by Sandor closes in to meet them. Ship-to-ship fighting commences between the two fleets, and the Three Whores begin launching stones into the fray as well. Stag of the Sea demolishes one of Joffrey's galleys, while Dog's Nose is set on fire. Davos spies Queen Alysanne trapped between Lady's Shame and Lady of Silk and goes to ramming speed. Black Betha and Lady Marya ram Lady's Shame together, and the enemy ship falls to pieces. Queen Alysanne is soon engulfed in wildfire that erupts from the ruins of Lady's Shame, as is her other opponent, Lady of Silk. Moments later, Bold Laughter is hit by a boulder from one of the Whores and explodes. A swarm of smaller boats begin entering the river, none of them large enough to make a difference. Black Betha is rammed by White Hart, but Davos manages to turn so his ship does not sink. His men board the other galley and soon capture her. Davos has a chance to look over the battle. Courageous is sinking, Dragonsbane has had its bottom ripped out, Red Raven is listing, and Stag of the Sea is fighting fires and boarders. Loyal Man, another of Joffrey's ships, has been captured. The battle is almost over. Matthos calls his attention to Swordfish, just now entering the battle and about to ram one of the old hulks. Davos, with horror, sees wildfire leaking out of the ship. Swordfish collides with the hulk, and a gigantic explosion occurs. Davos is knocked overboard. When he comes to the surface, he sees a towering column of wildfire fifty feet high. Swordfish and the hulk have both vanished. Black Betha, Piety, Cat, Courageous, Sceptre, Red Raven, Harridan, Faithful, and Fury are already in flames, as are White Hart, Loyal Man, Kingslander, and Godsgrace on the Lannister side. As Davos watches, Pride of Driftmark is hit and starts burning as well. Davos is starting to be pushed out into the bay, but when he turns around, he sees that the chain has finally been lifted. Over a dozen ships have slammed into it already, and Davos fears his life is over.","Tyrion watches the ships burn in the river from the walls. Joffrey is there too and points out several ships of his fleet that are burning, Kingslander, Queen Cersei, Loyal Man, and Seaflower. Tyrion laments the loss of the fleet, but knows that Stannis would have never taken the bait without the ships there and that the fleet had been doomed anyway. Bronn is below at the towers and was responsible for raising the chain. The wildfire did not spread evenly, however. Many of the Myrish galleys escaped, as did much of Stannis's first and second lines. Eight ships landed troops, and there are still forty or so galleys ready to row Stannis's main force across the river. Tyrion sends a runner to Lord Jacelyn telling of the enemy below and sends another runner to tell Ser Arneld, commanding the Three Whores, to rotate his catapults thirty degrees. Joffrey is disappointed he is not with the Whores, as Cersei had promised he could command them. Tyrion gives his assent to go down to take charge. Joffrey had the Antler Men1 bound up naked with antlers nailed to their heads, and he is going to launch them from the Whores. Joffrey runs off, followed by Ser Meryn. Tyrion grabs Ser Osmund to remind him to keep the king safe. Another runner comes to tell Tyrion that hundreds of men have landed on the tournament grounds and are bringing a ram to the King's Gate. He gallops there, followed by Ser Mandon and Podrick. The ram is at the gate when he arrives. He orders a sortie, but Sandor refuses. He has led three sorties into the wildfire and refuses to go again. He is terrified. Tyrion realizes he must lead the charge himself, so he forms up the men and prepares to charge.","Cersei hosts in the Queen's Ballroom. Osney comes in from time to time to give updates, which Sansa is able to hear. Moon Boy and Dontos are entertaining the attendees. One of the younger women begins weeping, and Cersei has Maester Frenken take her away and give her something to help her sleep. Cersei tells Sansa some of the terrors that await if the castle falls and gives her some advice on how to use her womanhood as a weapon. The guests are nervous. Lollys eats too fast and vomits, while Lord Gyles drinks too much and passes out. Osney returns with Osfryd and reports that the wildfire has been unleasehd,1 while Osfryd reports that three servants tried to leave the castle with horses. Cersei has Ser Ilyn attend to them. A while later, Osfryd comes back to report that a group of rich merchants are at the gates of the castle asking for refuge. Cersei tells the sellsword to disperse them. As the day goes on, Cersei becomes more and more drunk. She bitterly laments that even though she and Jaime are virtually identical she was never allowed to learn the sword, warfare, or the other fields reserved for men. Osney comes with another report that the Mud Gate is under attack and Tyrion has led a sortie out the King's Gate.2 Cersei is worried for Joffrey and orders Osney to see that he is brought back to the castle. After the meal ends, many of the guests, including Lady Tanda, Falyse, and Lollys, go to the sept to pray. Cersei forces Sansa to drink some wine and tells her that she knows about her trips to the godswood. She tells Sansa that she had better stop praying for House Lannister's defeat, because she will go down with them. Ser Ilyn, back from beheading the traitors, is in the hall to kill Cersei, Sansa, and all the rest should the city fall.","Tyrion forms his men up into a spearhead, with him at the point. Ser Mandon takes the position on his right, while Podrick is at his left. Tyrion tells the boy to go, but he refuses, and there is no time to argue. Tyrion's wedge crashes into the men assaulting the King's Gate. They quickly disperse the attackers and make for the Mud Gate. The battle fever takes him as he hacks through more and more enemies. Finally, Ser Balon comes up to him and bids him look at the river. A large group of soldiers is crossing over a bridge created from entangled galleys. Half-sunken Dragonsbane forms the foot of the bridge. Tyrion leaps onto the ship and his horse breaks its leg and has to be killed. Tyrion fights on with Ser Balon and Ser Mandon. Suddenly, the ships tear loose from each other and Tyrion is spun about. He sees a battle on the south bank, which makes no sense because he has no forces there. Ser Mandon calls to him from another ship and tells Tyrion to take his hand. At the last second, Tyrion realizes that Ser Mandon is offering his off hand and jerks back just as the knight's sword slashes across his face. Tyrion is knocked into the water, but manages to grab an oar and pull himself back on deck. Ser Mandon prepares to finish him, but Podrick shoves the knight overboard, killing him.","Ser Lancel comes to tell Cersei that the battle is lost, Tyrion and Ser Mandon are likely dead, and Sandor is missing. He is furious at Cersei for having Joffrey withdraw because as soon as the gold cloaks saw the king leave, they began throwing down their spears and running. Osney comes in to report that there is now fighting on both sides of the river and that Stannis's lords may be fighting among themselves. He also reports that Sandor is missing and adds that Ser Balon has fallen back to the city and conceded the riverside to Stannis. The gold cloaks are deserting en masse and killing their officers, while mobs have formed at the Iron Gate, the Gate of the Gods, and Flea Bottom. Cersei turns to Osfryd and orders him to raise the drawbridge of Maegor's Holdfast and asks after Joffrey. He is at the gatehouse commanding crossbowmen that are trying to hold back a mob. Cersei orders him withdrawn to the keep. Lancel refuses, saying it will be the Mud Gate all over again, but Cersei slams her palm into his wound and leaves.
Sansa gets up and takes charge, trying to comfort the other women gathered there and having Moon Boy begin doing tricks to create a distraction. She orders two servants to help Lancel. Dontos comes up to her and tells her to lock herself in her bedchamber. She runs up the stairs to her chamber and opens her curtains to behold the sights of the battle. She decides to sleep. Suddenly, a figure comes out of the shadows and grabs her; it is Sandor. He is more drunk than ever. He tells Sansa that he is leaving the city, but first he wants the song he was promised. He tells Sansa he could keep her safe so that no one would hurt her anymore. She refuses to look at his face, and he pulls a knife and tells her to sing or die. The only song she can think of is a hymn to the Mother, which she sings. Sandor begins to weep, rips off his white cloak, and leaves. After a while, all the bells in the city start ringing, and Sansa can hear cheers in the streets. Dontos comes and tells her that the battle is won. All the might of Highgarden and Casterly Rock attacked Stannis while he was crossing the river. Lord Tywin had the right, Lord Randyll the center, and Lord Mace the left. It was the vanguard that won the battle though, which was led by Renly himself,1 who slew a dozen knights, including Ser Guyard.","Irri and Jhiqui dress Daenerys in the Dothraki style, and she goes to the waterfront with Aggo, Jhogo, and Ser Jorah. She must flee again, as Pyat Pree is gathering the surviving warlocks to do her ill. Xaro says that while the warlocks are shadows of their former selves, their powers appear to be growing again and many strange things are happening in Qarth. Ever since the House of the Undying collapsed, the people of Qarth have feared her. The Tourmaline Brotherhood has called for her expulsion, while the Ancient Guild of Spicers wants her dead. The Thirteen have not openly acted against her thanks to Xaro's efforts, but he has cooled as well. He offered one last time to marry her, but she refused. He then tried to buy a dragon for a few ships but was rebuffed. Afterward, he sent his seneschal to inform her that they must leave his house.
Daenerys speaks with Ser Jorah about her visions in the House of the Undying as they ride. He thinks they are meaningless, but she is sure they are important. Daenerys arrives at the docks and glances over the ships belonging to the Thirteen, including Xaro's own Vermillion Kiss, Bride in Azure, and Sunblaze, just arrived with slaves from Astapor on Slaver's Bay. Knowing none of the guild ships will help her, she talks to all the trading captains of the Summer Isles, the Free Cities, and Westeros to try and find passage for her people. The captains of Ardent Friend, Trumpeteer, Silken Spirit, and Lord Faro's Belly all refuse to take her, Quicksilver and Greyhound set too high a price, Pinchbottom Petto and Sloe-Eyed Maid are too small, Bravo is going the wrong direction, and Magister Manolo does not look seaworthy. As they head for another quay, Ser Jorah alerts her that two strangers are following them. They stop at a brass seller, and Daenerys sees them reflected in one of the platters. As they decide what to do, a man comes up and gives her a box with an onyx and emerald scarab inside. He gives his apologies as the scarab unfolds and reveals an almost human face and an arched tail dripping venom. Suddenly, the box flies out of her hand. All is confusion for a few moments as Aggo and Jhogo arrive and apprehend one of the men that were following her. Daenerys orders him released. The man who gave her the box was a Sorrowful Man, and the creature within was a manticore. The old man saved her by knocking it out of her hand and killing it. He introduces himself as Arstan and his companion as Belwas, whom he is squiring for. They were sent by Illyrio to bring Daenerys back to Pentos and have brought three ships with them, Saduleon, Summer Sun, and Joso's Prank. Daenerys agrees to go with them, but says the ships must be renamed Vhagar, Meraxes, and Balerion.","Arya is walking back from the well with water. On the way, she passes the heads of those Lord Roose had killed as Lannister collaborators, including Maester Tothmure, who sent off ravens to Lord Tywin when the castle fell, Lucan the armorer, who made weapons for the Lannisters, Goodwife Harra, who told the household to serve Lord Tywin, and the steward of the castle, who gave Lord Tywin the keys to the vault. Goodwife Amabel stops her and points at Pia and several other girls that have been stripped, shaved, and placed in stocks for the use of any who want them as punishment for sleeping with Lannister troops, and warns that Arya will be put there next when Lord Roose loses Harrenhal. The castle is not a happy place. Gendry has been complaining to Arya that things are worse with Roose and the Brave Companions in charge. He finds the Brave Companions particularly despicable, as Septon Utt likes little boys, Qyburn is rumored to practice black magic, and Biter eats people. Vargo has been put in charge of finding Lannister collaborators. Every day, he rides out and finds those who aided Lord Tywin and kills a few more. Arya hates the Companions as well, including Shagwell, Rorge, and Urswyck. On her way to Lord Roose, she is stopped by his squire, Elmar, who needs a hand pushing a barrel. After helping him, she finally arrives at Roose's bedchamber, where he is being bled with leaches while meeting with Qyburn, Steelshanks Walton, and several Freys, including Ser Aenys, Ser Jared, and Ser Hosteen, as well as Ser Harys Haigh, and Ronel Rivers. The Freys believe that the war is now lost with Stannis defeated and the north taken, and that Robb must make peace. Lord Roose promises to think on what they have said and dismisses them. Qyburn reads a letter to Roose from his wife, Fat Walda. She writes every day to wish him well. Roose tells Qyburn to send a letter to Ser Helman, who has recently captured the Darry castle. He is to put everyone to the sword, burn the castle, and then join with Robett to attack Duskendale. Lord Roose leaves to hunt wolves and tells Arya to tidy his chambers.
While cleaning the room, Arya notices a map of the riverlands and sees that Riverrun is not far. After tidying up, she goes to the godswood to practice her needlework, pretending the leaves are those she wants to kill. Lord Roose returns from his hunt that evening and tells her to get his dinner. When she returns, she asks if Roose means to take her with him when he leaves. He is annoyed at the questioning, but tells her that she is to stay with Vargo. She leaves and walks past the Wailing Tower, where the Freys are housed. She can hear shouting within. Elmar is on the steps and tells her that they have been dishonored and he will no longer be marrying his princess.1 Arya gets angry at him and tells him she wishes his princess dies before stalking off.2 She prays in the godswood and remembers Eddard's words about the pack surviving and the wolf's blood. Arya decides she can be as strong as Robb and breaks her broom sword in half; she is done with wooden swords. That night, Arya sneaks out of her chambers. She goes to the forge, wakes Gendry, and asks for him to get a sword and leave with her. She tells him that Roose is putting Vargo in charge and adds a lie that he is going to cut one foot off of each servant when he is in charge. She tells him to wake Hot Pie too and have him pack some food. She goes back to Roose's chambers and steals the map and a dagger before going to the stables and procuring three horses by saying Roose commanded her to get them. She goes to the Tower of Ghosts to wait for Gendry and Hot Pie, who finally arrive. Gendry says the postern gate is guarded, and Arya says she will get rid of the guard. She approaches him openly and tells him that Lord Roose is having her give a silver piece to all the guards for their service. She pulls out the coin Jaqen gave her and lets it drop to the ground. When the guard reaches to pick it up, she slits his throat. Gendry and Hot Pie join her and they leave the castle.","Joffrey and his court, including Cersei, Varys, Lord Gyles, Lady Tanda, Lollys, Falyse, Jalabhar Xho, the High Septon, Dontos, and Moon Boy, are gathered in the throne room. Sansa makes her way to the front of the gallery just as Lord Tywin rides in on his horse. Joffrey meets him at the base of the throne, names him Savior of the City, and asks him to assume governance of the realm. After Lord Tywin takes his seat, the heroes of the Battle of the Blackwater come forward one by one. First is Lord Mace, followed by his sons Ser Loras and Ser Garlan. Joffrey moves to greet them and allows them each a boon from the throne. Ser Loras asks for a place on the Kingsguard, Lord Mace asks for a seat on the small council, and Ser Garlan asks for Joffrey to marry Margaery. Joffrey grants the first two requests immediately, and after making a show of disavowing his betrothal to Sansa due to the traitorous actions of House Stark, Joffrey agrees to marry Margaery as well. Sansa is elated to finally be free. The heroes continue to file in. First there is Lord Paxter and his sons Horas, limping from a wound sustained in the fighting, and Hobber, followed by Lord Mathis, Lord Randyll, Ser Kevan, Ser Addam, Lord Lewys, Lord Roland, and Ser Flement.1 Following them are men of lesser rank who distinguished themselves: Ser Philip Foote, who slew Lord Bryce Caron; Lothor Brune, who captured Ser Jon Fossoway and slew Ser Bryan Fossoway and Ser Edwyd Fossoway to earn the name Lothor Apple-Eater; Willit, a man-at-arms in service to Ser Harys, who saved his master's life; and Josmyn Peckledon, a young squire who killed two knights, wounded another, and captured two more. Ser Philip is made Lord Philip and granted the Caron lands, rights, and incomes; Lothor is made a knight and promised lands somewhere in the riverlands; Josmyn is given a sword, suit of plate, warhorse, and the promise of knighthood when he comes of age; and Willit is given new weapons and armor and the honor of his two sons being taken as a squire and a page at Casterly Rock.
Next come the captains of Prince Aemon, Wildwind, and River Arrow, and officers from Godsgrace, Lance, Lady of Silk, and Ramshead. They are basically being honored just for surviving. Hallyne is raised to the title of lord, but without any accompanying lands or incomes. Ser Lancel is granted the lands of House Darry, though he is too grievously wounded to accept the honor in person. Lord Petyr comes in next and is raised to Lord Paramount of the Trident, with Harrenhal as his seat. Next, six hundred men are brought in to be knighted by Ser Meryn, Ser Osmund, and Ser Balon. When this is done, the prisoners are brought in. These include Lord Ardrian; Ser Bonifer the Good; Lord Estermont; Lord Steffon, who has a shattered knee; Ser Mark, who has lost his left arm to the elbow; Red Ronnet; Ser Dermot of the Rainwood; Lord Willum and his sons Josua and Elyas; Ser Jon; Ser Timon the Scrapesword; Aurane Waters, the bastard of Driftmark; and Lord Alesander Staedmon. Those who have not already sworn fealty are given the chance now. One man calls out defiant, and Joffrey has Ser Ilyn take him away for execution. Another man jumps up and calls Joffrey a monster that must be destroyed. Joffrey gets agitated and calls for the man's death, cutting himself on the Iron Throne in the process. Cersei goes to him, and she and three maesters bundle him off as Ser Meryn kills the man taunting him. Lord Tywin takes over and resumes taking pledges of fealty. After the session is over, Sansa returns to her room to eat and then goes to the godswood. Dontos tells her that the day of her escape has been chosen, Joffrey's wedding night. He gives her a hair net with black amethysts from Asshai. He tells her it represents justice, vengeance, and home.2","Maester Luwin comes to Theon in his chambers and tells him he must yield. Birds have been sent to King Balon and Victarion, but there has been no answer. Theon ignores the maester's advice and tells him to assemble the garrison in the yard. He tells them that Ser Rodrik will be there soon and that he means to hold the castle or die trying. He draws a line in the dirt and tells the men that any who will stay should step over the line. At first, no one moves, with Urzen shuffling his feet, Dykk Harlaw spitting onto the ground, and Endehar and the others making no move. Wex crosses first, followed by Lorren. Seventeen cross in all, including Red Rolfe, Kromm, Werlag, Tymor and his brothers, Ulf the Ill, Harrag Sheepstealer, four Harlaws, two Botleys, and Kenned the Whale. Among those refusing to cross are Urzen, Stygg, and the ten men that Asha left at the castle. Theon arms for battle and then goes to the battlements to observe the northern host. It numbers at least a thousand, with catapults and scorpions. The army consists primarily of Cerwyn, Tallhart, and Manderly forces, but Houses Flint, Karstark, and Hornwood are also represented. Cley comes forward to announce that Ser Rodrik wants a parlay with Theon Turncloak. Theon mounts Smiler and rides past Gage and several others who stare at him with hatred, out the castle, and to the market square, where Cley and Ser Rodrik await. Ser Rodrik tells him that if he yields himself and the castle, his men may go free. Theon counters with his own terms, that Ser Rodrik's army swear fealty and leave. He gives a signal, and Lorren brings Beth to the walls with a noose around her neck. Theon tells Ser Rodrik that the army must disperse by sundown, or Beth will hang. Every dawn and dusk thereafter will bring another hanging.
Back at the castle, Theon gloomily ponders his fate all day. Maester Luwin comes to him as he shoots targets in the archery yard and tells him that his last hope is to join the Night's Watch. Theon warms to the idea until Kromm reports that several hundred northmen under the banner of House Bolton are attacking Ser Rodrik's army. Theon watches with Maester Luwin and Lorren as the new force hacks the other to pieces. Sometime after nightfall, a knight in dark armor with a red helm comes to the gates and presents the bodies of Ser Rodrik, Cley, and Leobald. Theon lets him and his army into the castle. Red Helm reveals that he came as a friend and when Ser Rodrik gave him his hand, he took half his arm instead. He takes his helm off, and Theon realizes it is Reek. Ramsay explains that, in an attempt to save his life, he traded places with Reek when Ser Rodrik came for him. He asks for the girl he was promised for bringing the men, his father's garrison. Theon sends Harrag for Palla, but Ramsay says he wants Kyra instead. Theon balks and Ramsay strikes him with a gauntleted fist, shattering his cheekbone. Bolton men begin streaming in. Theon sees Red Rolfe and Kenned cut down, followed by Lorren and Ulf. Maester Luwin comes towards him, but is stabbed and run down. Ramsay shouts to spare the Freys and burn the rest. The last thing Theon sees is Smiler, his mane ablaze, kicking free of the stables.","Tyrion dreams of the aftermath of the battle and corpses while lying among the wounded. He wakes up some time later in a soft bed, but is soon asleep again. When he wakes next, he feels bandages where his mouth should be. Podrick is there and fetches Maester Ballabar, who puts Tyrion back to sleep. He dreams again, this time of a victory feast, before he wakes once more. After a brief struggle to get out of bed, he falls asleep and dreams of Tysha and the little cottage they shared while married. When he wakes again, Ballabar is there and prepares to put him back to sleep. Tyrion grabs the maester's chain and chokes him to make him stop. He orders the maester to take the bandages off, and he complies after a threat of more choking. The wound underneath appears clean. Ballabar explains that Tyrion's wounds were filthy when they found him in the cellar and that he had a broken rib and an arrow wound at the shoulder joint that had mortified. He almost lost the limb, but they were able to treat it with boiling wine and maggots. Tyrion tells the maester to bring a looking glass. He sees that the cut starts just below his left eye and took three-quarters of his nose and part of his lip. He asks where he is, and Ballabar answers that he is in a chamber above the Queen's Ballroom; Cersei wanted to be able to watch over him personally. Tyrion believes that she wanted him to succumb to his wounds. He wants to return to his chambers and is shocked to learn that Lord Tywin is in the city and has taken the position of Hand. He tells Ballabar to bring Podrick. Tyrion tells Podrick to send Ballabar away and have Frenken make him some dreamwine. He tells the lad to bring Bronn too, who Podrick tells him has been knighted.","Qhorin has Jon build a fire, a sign that the end has come. They are the only two left. Dalbridge was not able to hold the wildlings long, and soon after his death, the eagle spotted the others. Qhorin ordered Ebben to make for the Fist by the fastest route while the others tried to draw off the pursuers in another direction. After several days of this, Stonesnake's mare took a fall and broke a leg. Qhorin decided to send Stonesnake over the mountains to try and reach the Fist. Qhorin tells Jon that if they are taken, Jon must yield and join the wildlings to act as a spy. Qhorin says they will double back and hope the fire leads their pursuers past them. They stop in a hidden cave beyond a waterfall that Qhorin says goes all the way through the mountain. If they are not discovered, they will press on that way. When they emerge the next day, the eagle is waiting. Soon, they can hear horns in the distance. Fourteen wildlings and eight dogs approach along with the eagle. Their leader, Rattleshirt, the Lord of Bones, rides forward and Qhorin greets him. Rattleshirt shows them Ebben's head and says their fate will be the same. As the wildlings begin to taunt them, Qhorin tells Jon to remember his orders, and Jon yields. Rattleshirt does not want to take him in, but Ygritte is there and vouches for him. The eagle is furious. Ygritte explains that the mind of the man Jon killed in the Skirling Pass1 is trapped in the eagle and hates him for it. Rattleshirt orders a woman named Ragwyle to kill him anyway, but the woman says he should be allowed to prove his worth. Rattleshirt orders him to kill Qhorin, and the Halfhand leaps to the attack. They fight for a while until Ghost bites Qhorin and Jon uses the opening to kill him. Rattleshirt still wants to kill him, but the others shout him down, and he is accepted. Jon asks if they are going back to the Skirling Pass, but Ygritte tells him that Mance is already marching for the Wall.","Summer and Shaggydog watch from the trees as Winterfell burns. The next morning, they enter the castle to see it mostly destroyed, with bodies scattered everywhere. Meera brings Bran back into his body, and he reluctantly closes his third eye. He awakens in total blackness with Hodor holding him. He tells Meera what he saw. Jojen tells him that he was out for three days, which is far too long. He cannot eat or drink when he is in his wolf. He has opened his third eye and can enter Summer whenever he wishes now. He tells Osha about his dream and says they must go see what happened. Osha lights a torch, which wakes Rickon. They are hiding in the crypts of Winterfell by Lord Eddard's empty tomb. The light of the torch dances on the other tombs and makes it look to Bran as if the dead are rising: Lyanna, Brandon, Lord Rickard, Rickard's father Lord Edwyle, Lord William and his brother Artos, Lord Donnor, Lord Beron, Lord Rodwell, Lord Jonnel, Lord Barth, Lord Brandon, and Lord Cregan. After Bran says he is sure it is safe, Osha agrees to take a look. As they walk, they pass the tombs of the Kings in the North, including Torrhen, Edwyn, Theon, Brandon the Burner, Brandon the Shipwright, Jorah, Jonos, Brandon the Bad, Walton, Edderion, Eyron, Benjen the Sweet, Benjen the Bitter, and Edrick Snowbeard. When they reach the entrance, Osha cannot get the door open because something is blocking it, so Hodor has to go up and force it open. They emerge into ruin. The great walls still stand, but most of the rest is destroyed. Bran recognizes Poxy Tym's corpse, and Osha spots the bodies of Smiler and Lorren. The wolves join them and lead them to the godswood, where Maester Luwin lies mortally wounded under the weirwood tree. He is pleased to see Bran and Rickon, though he knew they were still alive because he could tell that Bran's duplicate had not broken his legs in a fall. He tells Osha that they must be spirited away separately, but that most of the north is not safe. He asks Osha to finish him, which she does after the boys leave.1 Osha will take Rickon, while Hodor, Meera, and Jojen will go with Bran. Osha departs, and then Jojen tells Bran they will head north. Bran looks back at the castle one last time and thinks that it is not gone, merely broken like him."
