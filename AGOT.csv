"Gared attempts to convince his commander, Ser Waymar Royce, to turn back, as the wildlings are all dead according to Will. Ser Waymar mocks him for his unease, but Will notices that Gared is afraid despite having been in the Night's Watch for forty years. Will is uneasy also. He has spent four years in the Watch and been on at least a hundred rangings, but this is the first time the haunted forest has ever terrified him. They have been traveling north for nine days pursuing wildling raiders, and every day has been colder and worse than the day before. Ser Waymar refuses to turn back, however. The youngest son of an ancient house with too many heirs, he is young and has only been in the Watch for half a year. Gared insists that they have done all that Mormont ordered and that they could already have a two week ride ahead of them if it snows. Waymar asks Will to repeat what he saw again. Will had been a poacher before joining the Watch, until Mallister freeriders had caught him and given him the choice of losing a hand or going to the Wall. He is the best in the Watch at moving through the woods unseen. He reports that the wildling camp is two miles away and that he spied eight men and women there. None of them moved an inch the entire time he surveyed the camp, including a spotter up in the trees. Gared says they must have been killed by the cold and that he had seen a man freeze during the last winter and also during the one before that when he was a boy.1 Ser Waymar points out that it has not been cold enough for a man to freeze and orders Will to take him to the camp.
They ride into the night, before dismounting at Will's suggestion to go the rest of the way. Gared becomes uneasy once again, but Waymar only mocks him and tells him to watch the horses while he and Will continue on foot. Gared wants a fire, but Waymar refuses so as not to draw enemies. Gared claims it will keep away some enemies such as bears, direwolves, and ""other things,""2 but Waymar is firm. As they reach the campsite, Will is shocked to see that the bodies are gone. Waymar refuses to go back to Castle Black from his first ranging a failure, and so he orders Will to climb a tree and look for any sign of the wildlings. As he climbs, Will hears Ser Waymar issue an uncertain challenge. The Others, however, make no sound as they glide through the forest towards Ser Waymar. Will sees them briefly, but assumes it was a mirage. Waymar calls out to Will and asks why it is so cold, and Will realizes that it is now freezing. An Other comes out of the shadows to challenge Waymar. As Will watches, five more emerge silently to surround Waymar, but the knight does not see them. The newcomers watch as Waymar and the first Other fight. After a series of blows, the Other wounds Waymar in the side. Finding a last ounce of strength, Waymar shouts ""For Robert!"" and lunges forward, but when his sword meets the Other's blade, it shatters. Waymar falls to his knees screaming and holding his face, and the Others all move in and butcher him. Will stays in the tree a long while after the Others depart before gathering the courage to come down. He decides to take the twisted, broken sword as proof of what happened and hopes that if Gared does not know what to make of things, then Mormont or Maester Aemon will. As Will stands, he sees Ser Waymar standing over him, his one good eye now sporting a burning blue pupil.3 Waymar grabs Will's throat and chokes him to death. His grip is icy cold.","It is the ninth year of summer.1 Lord Eddard Stark and twenty men2 are riding out to a holdfast to dispense the king's justice. Eddard's son Bran is excited because he has never been allowed to come along before. The man was captured in the hills outside a small holdfast. Robb believes the man must be a wildling sworn to Mance Rayder, the King-Beyond-the-Wall, and that makes Bran think of the tales Old Nan has told him about wildlings, including that they are slavers, slayers, and thieves, consorted with giants and ghouls, and lay with the Others to sire half-human children. When they arrive at the holdfast, they discover the accused is an old man dressed in black who has lost his ears and a finger to frostbite.3 Bran sits between Robb and Jon with the banner of the Starks of Winterfell, a grey direwolf racing on a white field, flapping over their heads. Lord Eddard questions the man briefly, and then Theon Greyjoy brings him his sword, Ice, forged of Valyrian steel. After handing his gloves to the captain of the guard, Jory Cassel, Eddard executes the man in the name of Robert Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, by the word of Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. The head lands by Theon, who laughs and kicks it away. Jon, Bran's bastard brother, calls Theon an ass and compliments Bran on his poise during the execution.
On the way back to Winterfell, Robb comments that the deserter died bravely, but Jon notes he was already paralyzed by fear.4 Robb and Jon race ahead, but Bran holds back. Eddard comes up to him and explains that the man was a deserter from the Night's Watch and the penalty for desertion is death. He also explains that he had to execute the man himself because his family are of the blood of the First Men, and the First Men believe that the man who passes sentence should also carry it out. At that point, Jon reappears and beckons Eddard to come see what he and Robb have found. The party is shocked to see they have discovered a dead direwolf and her five live cubs, three male and two female.5 Theon comments that there has not been a direwolf seen south of the Wall in two hundred years, and Hullen, the master of horse, is uneasy that a direwolf has been discovered in the realm after so long. Many in the party are further disquieted when it is revealed the direwolf has an antler stag lodged in its throat, the apparent cause of death.6 Theon prepares to kill the pups, but Bran and Robb protest. Hullen's son, Harwin, points out they cannot keep the pups, and Hullen and Eddard agree. Jon points out that the number and gender match Eddard's children7 and says they were meant to have the pups. Bran is impressed that Jon has referenced both of Bran's sisters and even baby Rickon and given up any right to a wolf for himself to save the pups. Eddard relents and tells Jory and Desmond to gather up the pups. A little farther on, Jon hears something and goes back to discover a sixth cub, white with red eyes, which he takes for himself.8","Catelyn comes to Eddard in the godswood. It consists of three acres of untamed forest in the heart of Winterfell, a dark and primal place where the First Men worship the old gods. Catelyn does not like coming to the godswood, for she was raised in the Faith. Eddard has built a small sept for her use, but he still worships the old gods. Eddard is cleaning Ice beneath the heart tree, a great weirwood with a face carved in it. In the south, all the weirwoods have been cut down save on the Isle of Faces, where the green men still maintain them, but every godswood in the North still has its heart tree. The godswood of Winterfell has existed since before Brandon the Builder constructed the castle. Eddard asks after the children, and Catelyn tells him they are in the kitchen arguing over names for the direwolves. Arya and Sansa are excited, but Rickon is still a little afraid. Eddard says he must learn to face his fears, because ""winter is coming."" Those words give Catelyn a chill. Every house has its own words, or motto, and ""winter is coming"" are the words of House Stark. Eddard turns the conversation to the deserter he executed.1 He was the fourth deserter Eddard has been forced to execute in the last year and was half-mad. Catelyn admires Ice. It was forged in the freehold of Valyria before it was destroyed by the Doom, though the name dates back to the age of heroes, when the members of House Stark ruled as the Kings in the North. Ben has written to say that the strength of the Night's Watch has fallen below a thousand thanks to desertions and losses from rangings, and Eddard fears he may need to call his banners to deal with Mance Rayder. Catelyn fears for Eddard going beyond the Wall, for there are supposed to be many terrors in the Far North, but Eddard reassures her that the Others and the children of the forest have been gone for eight thousand years.
Catelyn tells Eddard the news she came to deliver, which is that Jon Arryn is dead. Eddard takes the news hard. He had fostered with Lord Jon at the Eyrie in his youth along with King Robert Baratheon. When Aerys II Targaryen, the mad king, had demanded that Lord Jon deliver the heads of Robert and Eddard, Lord Jon raised his moon-and-falcon banners in rebellion instead.2 Fifteen years ago they became brothers as well when Eddard and Jon married Lord Hoster Tully's daughters.3 Robert wrote the letter bearing the news of Jon's death himself and explained that Jon took ill so quickly that Grand Maester Pycelle was powerless to aid him.4 Jon's wife5 has taken their son6 and returned to the Eyrie. Catelyn wishes she had gone to Riverrun instead, as the Eyrie is high and lonely and her sister will need friends and family to comfort her. Eddard points out that her uncle, Brynden, will be there, as Jon named him Knight of the Gate, but Catelyn fears that is not enough. Eddard suggests she go to her, but Catelyn says she cannot because the king is coming to Winterfell. Eddard is pleased that the king is coming, and decides to have Maester Luwin send a swift bird to the Wall so his brother, Ben, will be able to see the king too. Catelyn says that there will probably be a hundred knights with their retainers and fifty freeriders with the king's party. Queen Cersei and her children7 are coming as well, and so are the queen's brothers.8 This gives Eddard pause, as he resents the Lannisters of Casterly Rock for coming to Robert's cause late. Still, he is pleased at the thought of seeing the children, as the youngest, Prince Tommen, was still a suckling babe last Eddard saw him.9 Eddard says he will arrange for Jory to lead an escort of honor to meet the royal party on the kingsroad and wonders how they will take care of such a large party on such short notice.","Viserys Targaryen gives his sister, Daenerys, a fine silk dress so she will look a princess that night. The dress is a gift from Illyrio Mopatis, who has been their host for half a year. Daenerys wonders why Illryio, a dealer in spices, gemstones, dragonbone, and contraband that would gladly sell his closest friend for the right price, is being so helpful. Viserys says it is because Illyrio knows there will be a reward when he comes into his throne. Daenerys is not so sure, but does not want to make Viserys angry and ""wake the dragon."" Viserys is preparing to present Daenerys to Khal Drogo, and hopes he will take her as his wife. He warns her not to fail him and wake the dragon and twists one of her nipples for emphasis. After Viserys leaves, Daenerys looks out over the towers of Pentos, listening to the red priests at their nightfires and the children playing in the streets. She thinks of Westeros, the home she never knew. Viserys talks of Westeros all the time, speaking of how it was stolen from them and telling her of wondrous places such as Casterly Rock, the Eyrie, Highgarden, the Vale of Arryn, Dorne, and the Isle of Faces. Viserys was eight when they fled the Seven Kingdoms, but Daenerys was still in her mother's womb. Viserys has also told her of the events that led to their exile. How they were evacuated in the dead of night to Dragonstone, how Rhaegar battled the Usurper in the waters of the Trident and died for the woman he loved,1 how King's Landing was sacked by the ""Usurper's dogs,"" lords Lannister and Stark,2 how Princess Elia begged for mercy as Rhaegar's heir was taken from her and murdered,3 4 and how the Kingslayer opened her father's throat in the throne room with a golden sword.5
Daenerys was born nine months after the flight to Dragonstone, during a vicious storm that destroyed the Targaryen fleet. Her mother6 died giving birth to her, an event for which Viserys has never forgiven her. The Usurper's brother7 was sailing for Dragonstone, the last remaining stronghold of House Targaryen, with a newly built fleet, and the garrison was ready to sell her and Viserys and surrender. Ser Willem Darry and four men were able to spirit them away to Braavos before that could happen. Ser Willem soon grew ill and was bedridden for several years before dying. The servants stole what little money was left at his death, and Viserys and Daenerys took to wandering the Free Cities, staying briefly in Myr, Tyrosh, Qohor, Volantis, and Lys in turn. At first, they were welcomed in the halls of the powerful, but as the years passed, they were gradually shunned and forced to sell off their few remaining treasures to survive, including their mother's crown, and Viserys became known as the beggar king. Viserys lusts after the Seven Kingdoms, but all Daenerys wants is to return to the house with the red door and the lemon tree in Braavos where they had lived with Ser Willem.
Servants come to bathe Daenerys, and one of them talks all the while about how lucky she is to be marrying Drogo. Daenerys had always assumed she would marry Viserys, as the Targaryens had been marrying brother to sister for centuries to keep their Valyrian lineage pure. Daenerys dresses and joins Viserys and Illyrio for the journey to Khal Drogo's manse. Viserys is in a good mood on the trip, certain that ten thousand riders from Drogo's khalasar will be enough to reclaim the Seven Kingdoms. He is sure that he will have support from Tyrell, Redwyne, Darry, and Greyjoy, none of which are fond of the Usurper, and he believes that Dorne will rise to avenge Elia as well.8 Illyrio eggs him on, telling Viserys that his agents in the Seven Kingdoms report the people eagerly await their rightful king's return. Khal Drogo's manse is an immense structure with nine towers right on the bay. It was a gift from the magisters of Pentos, who have bought off the Dothraki to stop them from looting the city, though they claim not to fear the Dothraki because the red priests have assured them the Lord of Light will not let them breach the walls. An Unsullied in Drogo's employ meets them at the gate and lets them in. Most of the guests at the party are Dothraki, but there are men from the Free Cities of Pentos, Myr, and Tyrosh as well, and also a few from Ibben and the Summer Isles. Illyrio points out some of the more notable guests, including Drogo's bloodriders,9 Khal Moro and his son, Rhogoro, the brother of the Archon of Tyrosh, and Ser Jorah Mormont. Daenerys is surprised that a knight would be there, and Illyrio explains that he fled Westeros after selling two poachers into slavery. Viserys says he must speak to Ser Jorah. Illyrio points out the khal and leaves to bring him over. Daenerys is terrified by the sight of him and wants to leave, but Viserys rants at her and hurts her and tells her they need his khalasar to retake the Seven Kingdoms. Daenerys smiles and stands up straight at Viserys's command as Illyrio brings Drogo over to them.","The King's party, three hundred strong,1 arrives at Winterfell beneath the crowned stag of House Baratheon. Eddard recognizes Ser Jaime Lannister, Sandor Clegane, and Tyrion Lannister immediately, but the king himself, flanked by two knights of the Kingsguard2 looks practically a stranger. Eddard has not seen the king since Greyjoy's Rebellion nine years ago, when Eddard and Robert joined forces to deal with Balon Greyjoy, who proclaimed himself king of the Iron Islands, and Eddard took Balon's son, Theon as his ward. Since that time, Robert has grown fat. Robert greets Eddard and Catelyn warmly, and Eddard greets Queen Cersei and her children3 as well. With the greetings out of the way, Robert immediately demands to go down to the crypts to pay his respects. Cersei begins to protest, but Jaime stops her. Once there, Eddard and Robert walk to the end of the rows of graves to where Eddard's father, Lord Rickard, his elder brother, Brandon, and his sister, Lyanna, are buried. Brandon was strangled by the order of Aerys II Targaryen days before he was supposed to wed Catelyn while Lord Rickard was forced to watch.4 Lyanna was sixteen when she died, and she was supposed to have married Robert. Robert pays his respects to the woman he loved and laments that she was buried deep underground. Eddard reminds the king that he was with Lyanna when she died and expressed a desire to be buried with her father and brother. He also remembers the promise he made to her, and how the fear went out of her eyes when he made it.5 6 Eddard's companions found him clutching her body some time later, and the crannogman Howland Reed had to take his hand from hers. Robert tells Eddard how he vowed to kill Rhaegar for what he did to Lyanna. Eddard reminds Robert that he did so, and Robert laments that he could only do so once. It had been during a battle at a ford on the Trident. Robert and Rhaegar met in single combat in the river, until Robert landed a killing blow to Rhaegar's chest with his warhammer.
Robert tells Eddard that Lord Jon's sickness came on suddenly. He had been healthy and fit on the tournament for the nameday of Robert's son, but two weeks later he was dead. Robert fears that his death drove Lysa mad. She refused to let her son, Robert, be fostered by Lord Tywin Lannister at Casterly Rock and withdrew to the Eyrie in the dead of night. Lord Tywin had never taken a ward before, and Robert feels Lysa should have been honored. Eddard offers to foster him at Winterfell, but Robert says that he cannot offer Robert to another now that Tywin has accepted. Robert also says that Jon's son will not be granted the title of Warden of the East that has always belonged to House Arryn. Eddard is surprised, but Robert says that a sickly boy cannot be a war leader. Eddard points out that the title is only an honor when the realm is at peace, but Robert will hear no more of it. Robert explains that he came north to make Eddard the Hand of the King to replace Lord Jon. The Hand is the second most powerful man in the kingdom, speaking with the king's voice, commanding his armies, drafting his laws, and even dispensing justice from the Iron Throne in the king's name if he is indisposed. Eddard does not want the position, but Robert is insistent and even plans to betroth his son Joffrey to Eddard's daughter, Sansa. Eddard asks for time to think the offer over.","Jon Snow is sitting near the back of the great hall in Winterfell during the welcome feast for King Robert.1 Earlier, he got a good look at the royal family as they came in. Eddard escorted in Queen Cersei, followed by Catelyn and Robert, then Rickon, Robb and Princess Myrcella, Arya and Prince Tommen, Sansa and Joffrey, Jaime and Tyrion, and, finally, Benjen Stark and Theon Greyjoy.2 Jon has been drinking for the entire feast, and is now quite drunk. Ghost peeks his head up from under the table looking for food, and Jon gives his direwolf half a chicken to devour. A dog comes up to challenge Ghost for a share, but all it takes is a baring of his fangs to make the dog slink away. Ben Stark comes over to see Ghost. He remarks on how quiet the wolf is, and Jon explains that he never makes a sound, which is how he got his name. Ben admires Jon's keen skills of observation and remarks that he could use a man like him on the Wall. Jon, drunk, asks to join the Night's Watch. Ben tells him the Wall is a hard place for a boy, but Jon protests that he is nearly a man and that bastards have to grow up faster than other children. He also talks of Daeron Targaryen, who conquered Dorne at the age of fourteen, but Ben points out that the conquest only lasted a summer and that he had lost ten thousand men conquering the place and another fifty thousand trying to hold it. Furthermore, he was dead at eighteen.
Jon still wants to join the Watch, knowing there is no place for him at Winterfell in the long run as a bastard. Ben tells him that the members of the Watch are not allowed to marry or father children and that he should know what he is giving up and father a few bastards of his own first. Jon hotly states he will never father a bastard, which draws all eyes to him. Jon runs out of the hall in tears. Outside, he runs into Tyrion perched on the ledge above the door. He has drunk too much wine and come out for air. As Jon watches, he vaults down from the ledge and comes over to see Ghost. Ghost bares his fangs at Tyrion at first, but on Jon's command lets Tyrion pet him. Tyrion tells Jon that he should make being a bastard his strength so that fact cannot be used against him by his enemies. When Jon asks what he could possibly know about being a bastard, Tyrion replies that all dwarfs are bastards in their fathers' eyes. His mother3 died giving birth to him and his father4 treats him terribly for it. Tyrion goes on to say that all dwarfs are bastards, but that all bastards need not be dwarfs. As he walks back into the hall, the light throws Tyrion's shadow across the yard, and for an instant, he looks as tall as a king.","Catelyn and Eddard are in their bedchamber after making love. Catelyn's bedchamber is always warm thanks to the hot springs that run under Winterfell and course through the walls. The warmth reminds her of Riverrun and days spent with Lysa and Edmure. Eddard states his firm resistance to becoming Hand of the King, but Catelyn cautions him that he must, for Robert may come to suspect his loyalty if he says no. Eddard is still not convinced, saying that Robert would never harm him and Sansa is too young to be betrothed. Catelyn points out that she was twelve when she was betrothed to Brandon, and Eddard wishes that Brandon was there, as he was the one raised to rule. Desmond interrupts and says Maester Luwin is waiting for an audience. He enters and explains that someone left a small box with a Myrish lens and a note in his chambers. He suspects a member of the King's party. The message is for Catelyn from Lysa, written in a secret language she and Catelyn invented as children, and claims that Cersei murdered Jon.1 Catelyn says that Eddard must become the Hand now so he can investigate the murder, and he reluctantly agrees. He laments that his father went south at the summons of a king too and never returned.2
Eddard orders Catelyn to stay and rule the North in his stead and prepare Robb to rule one day. He will also leave Rickon, as he is still a baby, but Arya, Sansa, and Bran will go south with him. Catelyn begs Eddard to leave Bran, her favorite, as he is only seven, but Eddard points out that he was eight when sent to foster at the Eyrie. Furthermore, Ser Rodrik has informed him of bad blood between Robb and Joffrey, and Eddard feels Bran can help bridge the gap by becoming close to the royal family. Maester Luwin asks what is to be done with Jon Snow. Catelyn has always hated her husband's bastard and resented him for it. She has forgiven him for fathering a bastard, as they were apart for their first year of marriage while Eddard fought in the war and she remained at Riverrun pregnant with Robb. What she cannot forgive is how Eddard treated him like a trueborn son and brought him to live at Winterfell. She heard rumors that Eddard fathered Jon on Ashara Dayne when he went to Starfall to return the sword3 of Ser Arthur Dayne, the deadliest knight of the Kingsguard, after slaying him in single combat.4 Catelyn asked him about those rumors once, and it was the only time Eddard ever frightened her. He told her never to ask about Jon again and all she needed to know was that Jon was of his blood.5 Eddard also wants Jon to remain at Winterfell, but Catelyn refuses to have him. Maester Luwin mentions that he had asked Ben about joining the Night's Watch, and Eddard agrees that this is the best solution.","Arya is doing needlework under the eye of Septa Mordane along with Sansa, Beth Cassel, Jeyne Poole, and Princess Myrcella. She is embarrassed by the poor quality of her work and runs off. Arya resents that Sansa is beautiful and more polished than she is. Nymeria greets her at the base of the stairs. Arya named the pup after Nymeria, the warrior queen of the Rhoyne who led her people across the Narrow Sea. Sansa named hers Lady.
Arya decides to go watch the boys sparring in the practice yard. She runs into Jon and Ghost, and they watch together. Bran and Tommen are fighting each other with heavily padded wooden swords under the watchful eye of Ser Rodrik Cassel, the master-at-arms, and a group of spectators, including Robb and Theon. Jon teases her as they watch. They have always got on well together, and are the only two of Eddard's children with Stark features, the other children all inheriting the Tully look. Jon also points out Prince Joffrey in the crowd, notes his arms, divided between the Baratheon stag and the Lannister lion, and comments that the Lannisters are over proud to make the queen's arms equal to the royal arms.
Bran defeats Prince Tommen. Rodrik tells Lew and Donnis to help the boys out of their armor and asks Robb and Joffrey if they would like to go another round. Joffrey wants to use real weapons, but Ser Rodrik refuses. Joffrey insults Robb, and Jon states that the prince is a little shit. Sandor steps forward to insult Rodrik and Robb. Joffrey adds his own insults and leaves with Tommen in tow. Arya returns to her room, where Catelyn and Septa Mordane are waiting to punish her for running off.","It is the last morning of the king's visit. King Robert has ridden out for one final hunt, along with Eddard, Robb, Benjen, Theon, Jory, Ser Rodrik, and Tyrion. Bran was left behind along with Jon, Rickon, Sansa, and Arya. Bran tried looking for Jon to keep him company, but he was nowhere to be found and has seemed angry at everyone since learning he was joining the Night's Watch. Bran is excited about going south. He wants to be a knight of the Kingsguard someday and do great deeds like Serwyn of the Mirror Shield, Ser Ryam Redwyne, Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, the twins Ser Erryk and Ser Arryk, who killed each other during the conflict known as the Dance of the Dragons, Gerold Hightower, Ser Arthur Dayne, and Barristan the Bold. Bran has admired the two Kingsguard that came to Winterfell with Robert, Ser Boros and Ser Meryn, from afar, but never dared to speak to them. Jaime is on the Kingsguard as well, but Robb told Bran he does not count since he killed the old, mad king.1 The greatest living knight is Ser Barristan Selmy, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, and Eddard has promised Bran he can meet the famed knight when they arrive at King's Landing.
Bran had meant to spend the day saying his farewells to those staying in Winterfell such as Old Nan, Gage the cook, Mikken the blacksmith, and Hodor the stableboy, but he discovered that saying goodbye was too sad and so he spent the day with his wolf2 instead. Bran has still not thought of a name for the pup. Robb has named his Grey Wind for his speed, Sansa calls hers Lady, Arya's is named after an old witch queen,3 and Rickon has named his Shaggydog, which Bran thinks is just stupid. Bran loves the name that Jon gave his pup, Ghost. Bran decides to go climbing and heads for the godswood, avoiding the heart tree which has always frightened him. As he is about to begin his ascent, his direwolf4 begins howling at him, but he goes on anyway. Bran has loved climbing all his life and has explored every nook of Winterfell. His mother always fears he will fall, and even made him promise to stop once, but he could not help himself and his father finally relented to let him continue.
Bran climbs around until he reaches an abandoned part of the castle, where he overhears a man and a woman talking. The woman is mad and afraid that Eddard is coming south and wishes she had insisted that Robert make the man Hand. Eddard puts them in danger, as Robert will listen to him unlike his own brothers, Stannis and Renly. The man is glad that Robert did not appoint one of his brothers or Littlefinger Hand, as he would rather have an honorable enemy. The woman, however, thinks that Eddard, who has never before taken an interest in affairs south of the Neck, can only be coming south to move against them. She mentions Lysa Arryn and her accusations. The woman is afraid of Lysa because she shared Jon's bed and might know what he knows.5 The man asks if Lysa has proof, and the woman says no, but that it will not matter because Robert does not love her. She fears what may happen when Joffrey comes to the throne and is afraid that Robert will cast her aside for someone he loves like he loved Lyanna Stark. Bran is frightened, but decides he must get closer to see who is talking. He sees the man and the woman having sex, though he does not realize that is what they are doing, and recognizes Cersei. Cersei spots Bran and screams, causing him to lose his grip. He manages to grab the ledge with one hand as he falls. Cersei and the man appear in the window, and Bran now recognizes the man as well, who appears a twin to Cersei.6 The man helps Bran up to the ledge, asks him how old he is, and then pushes him out the window. Bran falls to the ground far below; the last thing he hears is a wolf howling.","Tyrion is reading in the library, but is distracted by the constant howling of a wolf.1 Tyrion decides he is done for the evening and wakes Septon Chayle, who has fallen asleep atop a book on the life of Grand Maester Aethelmure. He gives the books and scrolls he was reading back into the care of the septon and warns him to be careful as some of them are quite rare, including Ayrmidon's Engines of War. Outside, men are drilling in the yard, and Tyrion hears Sandor comment on how he wishes Bran would just die, as he has been unconscious for several days since his fall. Tyrion comes over and tells Joffrey that he should pay his respects to Lord Eddard, but Joffrey does not see the point, so Tyrion slaps him and cows him into doing so. Tyrion proceeds to the guest house, where Cersei, Jaime, Tommen, and Myrcella are having breakfast. Cersei has always disliked Tyrion, while Jaime is the one person who has consistently shown him kindness since childhood. King Robert has not been sleeping, and has been at Lord Eddard's side since Bran's fall. Tyrion breaks the news that Maester Luwin thinks that if Bran were going to die, he would have already done so. Tommen and Myrcella are overjoyed, but Cersei and Jaime do not seem pleased. Tyrion explains that it has been four days since the fall with little change, which makes death less likely. Myrcella asks if Bran will get better, and Tyrion explains that his back was broken and his legs shattered in the fall and that he will never walk again even if he wakes up. Bran's wolf1 has been howling under his window nonstop since the fall, and when Maester Luwin closed the window, Bran seemed to weaken until it was opened again.2 Tyrion states that he intends to go north to see the Wall. Returning the conversation to Bran, Jaime says that he would not want to live a cripple and prefers a clean death.3 Tyrion, on the other hand, hopes the boy does wake up, because he thinks Bran may have an interesting story to tell.","Jon and Ghost come to see Bran. Lady Catelyn has been by his side for almost two weeks, taking her meals in the room and barely sleeping, and so Jon had not come before, but this is his last opportunity. Catelyn is very rude to him and tells him to go away, but he stands his ground. Bran is only skin and bones, with sunken eyes staring blankly and legs bent at odd angles. He cries and tells Bran's still form goodbye, explaining that he is leaving with Benjen that day to join the Night's Watch. Catelyn says that she had prayed for Eddard to leave Bran when he went south and that it appears sometimes prayers are answered. When Jon tries to comfort her, she is rude again. As Jon prepares to leave, Catelyn calls out to him and says it should have been him that fell before breaking into sobs.
Jon heads to the yard and sees Robb shouting orders with Grey Wind at his side. He has seemed to grow into authority since Bran's fall. They say their farewells. Finally he goes to see Arya, who is packing with Nymeria's help. Arya is happy to see him, as she was not allowed to leave her room to say goodbye. She had already packed her chest once, but she had just tossed everything in and Septa Mordane made her do it again properly. Jon gives Arya a present, a sword. He had Mikken forge the blade, which is slender and pointed like the swords used by bravos in Pentos, Myr and the other Free Cities. They say their goodbyes, and Jon tells her the sword has a name, Needle.","It is the wedding feast of Khal Drogo and Daenerys Targaryen. Drogo's entire khalasar -- 40,000 warriors and uncounted women, children, and slaves -- is gathered in a field outside of Pentos for the event. Pentos is uneasy, and Illyrio told Daenerys, Viserys, and Jorah, who swore fealty to Viserys the night of the engagement party, one night that the magisters have doubled the size of the city guard for the duration. Viserys seethes with impatience to get his promised crown, but Illyrio cautions him that Drogo will fulfill his promise in his own time and that first he has to take Daenerys to Vaes Dothrak to present her to the dosh khaleen. Ser Jorah adds that a lesser man must not presume to order the khal, and Viserys retorts that the dragon does not beg, but Daenerys thinks there are no more dragons. That night, she dreams of Viserys hurting her until a dragon appears in a burst of flame, and he disappears.
The ceremony lasts from dawn to dusk. Daenerys is seated on an earthen ramp next to Khal Drogo, with Viserys, Illyrio, and Ser Jorah right below her. Daenerys feels completely alone and frightened, and Drogo ignores her throughout the feast, as they do not share a common language. The feast is a raucous affair featuring a mass orgy and a dozen deaths. As the feast begins to wind down, she receives her gifts. From Viserys, she gets three handmaidens provided by Illyrio. Irri is to teach her riding, Jhiqui the Dothraki tongue, and Doreah the art of love. Ser Jorah gives her a collection of old books containing songs and histories of the Seven Kingdoms. Illyrio gives the greatest gift of all, three petrified dragon eggs from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai.
Next, the khal's bloodriders, Haggo, Cohollo, and Qotho, give her the traditional gifts of a leather whip with silver handle, an arakh chased in gold, and a curved dragonbone bow, each of which she refuses and gives to Drogo according to custom. After receiving many small gifts from other Dothraki, she is finally given Drogo's gift, a fantastic filly with a smokey silver mane.1 Finally Khal Drogo leads her off to consummate the marriage. Daenerys is afraid, but Drogo firmly yet gently takes her in hand and arouses her. They have sex.","Eddard is awoken by Alyn before dawn. King Robert is there with Ser Meryn, Ser Boros, and a dozen guardsmen, and he orders Eddard to ride with him and discuss matters of state. Robert is exhilarated by the chance to get out and ride and is impatient at the slow pace of the royal party. Robert wishes he could just keep on riding, give up the throne, and become a sellsword and vagabond. Robert asks about the mother of Eddard's bastard.1 Robert thinks her name was Becca, but realizes that was one of his women. Eddard tells him her name is Wylla, but will say no more. Robert says that Eddard is too hard on himself and that no woman wants Baelor the Blessed in her bed.
Robert shows Eddard a note that has just arrived from Varys, the master of whisperers who has held that post since Aerys II's reign. The letter contains information from Ser Jorah Mormont. Eddard is not fond of Ser Jorah, as he tried to sell two poachers to a Tyroshi slaver five years ago and dishonored the North. When Eddard came to his seat at Bear Island to dispense justice, he was not pleased to discover that Ser Jorah had fled. Ser Jorah is serving as an agent for Varys in the hope of receiving a royal pardon.
Ser Jorah's letter tells of the marriage of Daenerys and Drogo. Robert wants to send assassins after Daenerys. He has a hatred for all Targaryens, which led to a falling out between Eddard and Robert during Robert's Rebellion when Robert reacted with approval when presented with the bodies of Rhaegar's children by Lord Tywin. Eddard fought the last battles of the war alone in the south, and only Lyanna's death and their shared grief at her passing brought Eddard and Robert back together. Eddard thinks of Rhaegar's daughter2 dragged from under her bed crying and Rhaegar's baby son3 being torn from his mother's4 breast to have his head dashed against a wall and protests vigorously that harming a child is vile and unspeakable. Robert retorts that the way Brandon and Rickard died was unspeakable5 and that Rhaegar raping Lyanna was the worst sin of all. He means to see every Targaryen dead. He had wanted to send assassins after Daenerys and Viserys long ago, but Jon Arryn always stopped him.
Eddard presses Robert about naming a Warden of the East. He refuses to name Robert, particularly with the threat of a Dothraki invasion on the horizon, so Eddard advises he name Stannis, who proved himself at the siege of Storm's End. Robert admits to Eddard that he has already named Jaime Lannister Warden of the East, and Eddard is very uncomfortable, as this leaves half the realm's armies under the control of the Lannisters. Eddard expresses doubt that Jaime is trustworthy and reminds Robert that he did kill Aerys II. When this is not enough to convince Robert, Eddard decides to tell him the rest of the story, which he had always held back.
Robert had taken a wound from Rhaegar at the Trident, so he charged Eddard with the pursuit of the defeated Targaryen army while he recuperated. They fled to King's Landing, where Aerys still had a force of several thousand loyalists. Expecting to have to besiege the city, Eddard was surprised when he arrived to see that Lord Tywin Lannister had taken it. The war was almost a year old by this point, and Tywin had ignored calls from both sides to add his strength to their cause. After the Battle of the Trident, he appeared at the gates of King's Landing with 12,000 men professing to be an ally, but sacked the city when Aerys opened the gates. When Eddard arrived in the throne room of the Red Keep, he found Jaime seated atop the Iron Throne in his golden armor and Aerys dead at the foot of it. When Eddard challenged him, he got up, said he was just keeping the seat warm for Robert, and stated that it was not a comfortable seat. Robert is not concerned by the incident and rides on, leaving Eddard to doubt that he will be much use as Hand of the King.","Benjen Stark leaves for the Wall on the same day the King goes south. With him are Jon Snow and Ghost, Tyrion, and Tyrion's two serving men.1 On the way to the Wall, they meet up with another black brother, Yoren, who is bringing two rapers2 from the Fingers back to the Wall. At camp one night, Tyrion drinks an amber wine from the Summer Isles and reads a book about the history and properties of dragons, which have always fascinated him.
The first time Tyrion visited King's Landing for Cersei's wedding, he sought out the dragon skulls that had hung in the throne room. Robert had already replaced them with tapestries, but he managed to discover where they were stored and found them beautiful. There were nineteen in total, with the oldest large and impressive and the newer ones small and misshapen, including a matched pair with skulls no bigger than that of a mastiff that had belonged to the last two dragons born on Dragonstone, neither of which lived for very long. The three largest belonged to the dragons that Aegon I and his sisters3 rode in their conquest of Westeros, Balerion, Meraxes, and Vhagar.
None could stand before these dragons of legend, but King Loren of the Rock and King Mern IX of the Reach had tried close to three hundred years ago, when the Seven Kingdoms really were seven separate countries. They gathered five thousand knights and ten times as many other soldiers to face Aegon, who only had around a fifth of that number, mostly conscripts from the army of the last king he had slain.4 Aegon's army broke in the initial charge, but at that point, Aegon unleashed the dragons, the only time all three were deployed at once, and created what became known as the Field of Fire. Four thousand men perished, including King Mern, and both the Reach and the Westerlands were added to Aegon's domain, with King Loren swearing fealty.
Jon interrupts Tyrion's thoughts and asks the dwarf why he reads so much. Tyrion says that his mind is the only weapon he has, and he must keep it sharp, as he is a Lannister and is expected to do great things. Lord Tywin was Hand of the King to Aerys II for twenty years, Cersei married the new king, and Joffrey will be king in turn one day. Tyrion must do his part for the glory of his house as well, and therefore he must rely on his intellect. Jon wonders why he reads of dragons when they are all dead, and Tyrion replies that he used to dream of having a dragon of his own and started fires in the bowels of Casterly Rock that he would stare at for hours. Sometimes he would imagine that Tywin was burning in the fire; other times it was Cersei.
The talk turns to the Night's Watch, which Jon claims is a noble calling, and Tyrion breaks the truth to him that it is a midden heap filled with all the dregs of society. This upsets Jon and Tyrion moves to comfort him, but as he makes his move, Ghost leaps out of the shadows to tackle him. Jon helps Tyrion back up and realizes what Tyrion said about the Watch is true. Tyrion complements him for facing a hard truth rather than ignoring it and says he hardly ever dreams of dragons anymore. They return to camp, where the company has supper and goes to sleep, all save Jon who drew the first watch. As Tyrion turns in, he sees Jon staring intently into the fire.","It has been eight days since the King's party went south. Maester Luwin comes to Catelyn in Bran's room to go over the cost of the King's visit, but Catelyn refuses to. He also says that they must name a new steward, captain of the guard, and master of horse, as Vayon Poole, Jory Cassel, and Hullen have all gone south with Eddard. She gets nasty then until Robb comes in and says he will take care of things. Robb chastises her for never leaving Bran's room. Rickon has been following Robb and crying because he thinks everyone has abandoned him and Robb needs her help too. Outside, Bran's direwolf1 begins to howl, followed by Grey Wind and Shaggydog. Catelyn tells Robb to make them stop, but he says Bran needs to hear them. Catelyn collapses, but refuses to go to sleep in case Bran should die before she wakes.
Robb and Catelyn notice that the library tower is on fire. Robb rushes off and Catelyn only feels relief that the fire is not near Bran. She turns and sees a small man in filthy clothing with a knife who has come to kill Bran. They struggle, and Catelyn cuts her hand badly. Suddenly Bran's direwolf1 is in the room and kills the assassin. When Robb returns with Maester Luwin and Ser Rodrik, they find Catelyn laughing hysterically. Old Nan helps her to bed, and she sleeps for four days.
Catelyn wakes feeling weak, but no longer mad from grief and holds a council with Robb, Theon, Maester Luwin, Ser Rodrik and Hallis Mollen, the new captain of the guard. The assassin had been hiding in the stables and had a bag with ninety silver stags. He was obviously hired to kill Bran, but the question is by whom.2 They figure someone wanted him dead because he saw something he should not have.3 The assassin had a Valyrian steel dagger with a dragonbone hilt. Hallis leaves to put more guards on Bran's room, and the others continue to confer. Catelyn tells the others about Lysa's accusation that the Lannisters killed Lord Jon. Furthermore, she deduces that Bran did not fall, but was pushed, and guesses that it was Jaime Lannister that did it since he remained at Winterfell that day. Robb draws his sword in his anger, receiving a rebuke from Ser Rodrik. Catelyn is surprised to see him wearing steel now, and Ser Rodrik explains he felt it was time. She decides she must go to King's Landing with the dagger to discover its origin. Ser Rodrik asks to accompany her, and she agrees. They will follow the White Knife to White Harbor and take a ship from there to King's Landing.","Sansa takes breakfast with Lady and Septa Mordane in an inn then goes off with Lady to look for Arya. She finds Arya brushing Nymeria and tells her to wear something nice, as they are riding with Queen Cersei and Princess Myrcella today. Arya would rather explore the area with Mycah, a butcher's boy of thirteen. They have been going off every day of the journey to look at various things and explore. The party has recently emerged from the marshes of the Neck, which took twelve days to traverse. Arya runs off, and Sansa returns to the inn.
When Sansa arrives, she sees Barristan Selmy and Renly Baratheon kneeling before the queen. They have been sent from King's Landing as part of an escort of honor. Off to one side is Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's executioner. Ser Ilyn frightens her, and she steps back into Sandor, who mocks her. Joffrey goes to her then and makes everything better. Sansa is introduced to Barristan and Renly and tries to apologize to Ser Ilyn, who just walks away. Ser Barristan explains that Aerys II had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.1 Cersei has to talk to the new arrivals, so she has Joffrey take Sansa riding. Sansa is elated at the thought of a whole day with Joffrey and equates his rescue from Ser Ilyn and Sandor with Serwyn of the Mirror Shield's rescue of Princess Daeryssa from giants and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight's championing of Queen Naerys against the slanders of Ser Morgil. Joffrey suggests leaving Sandor and Lady behind. Sansa wonders if that is safe, and Joffrey reassures her by showing her his sword, Lion's Tooth. They head off on their ride.
Sansa and Joffrey explore caves and track a shadowcat to its lair. When they get hungry, they stop at a nearby holdfast. After lunch, where Joffrey drinks too much wine, they come across Arya and Mycah playing at being knights. Drunk, Joffrey threatens Mycah and prepares to hurt him, so Arya lunges at him and hits him in the back of the head. Joffrey whirls in a rage, speaking obscenities, and attacks Arya. Nymeria attacks Joffrey and tears at his sword arm. Arya calls off Nymeria and then throws Lion's Tooth into the river and leaves. Sansa tries to comfort Joffrey, who looks at her with loathing and tells her not to touch him. Sansa goes to get help.","Sansa takes breakfast with Lady and Septa Mordane in an inn then goes off with Lady to look for Arya.

They are staying at the castle of Ser Raymun Darry. The situation is tense, because House Darry fought for Aerys II, and Raymun lost his three older brothers at the Battle of the Trident. Eddard enters the audience chamber, where King Robert is presiding with Cersei and Joffrey. Arya, Jory, Ser Raymun, Lord Renly, and Ser Barristan are there as well. Eddard is furious that Arya was brought before the king, but Cersei responds that she must answer for the crime of attacking the crown prince. Joffrey claims that Arya and Mycah beat him with clubs and set Nymeria on him. Arya tells the true story as Vayon arrives with Sansa, and Lord Renly has a laughing fit at the thought of Joffrey being bested by a skinny girl with a stick, and is dismissed by Robert.
Eddard urges Sansa forward and tells her to say what happened. Sansa lies and says she does not remember, causing Arya to attack her. Cersei takes this as proof of Arya's wildness and demands that Robert punish her. King Robert decides that he and Eddard should discipline their children privately. Cersei brings up the direwolf. Nymeria is missing, so Robert is content to leave it at that. Cersei announces a reward for the man who brings her Nymeria's pelt and taunts Robert for not being a man. Cersei says they should execute Lady and Robert agrees, saying the animal would have turned on Sansa eventually anyway. Eddard challenges Robert to do it himself, but Robert leaves, and Eddard says he will do the deed if it must be done. He has Jory fetch Ice and uses it to kill Lady. He tells Jory to have four guards take the body back to Winterfell for burial. As he is returning to his quarters, Sandor comes back from searching. He found Mycah and rode him down.","Bran is falling in darkness. A voice tells him to fly, but he does not know how. The speaker is a crow who lands on his shoulder and exhorts him to fly. He looks down. He sees all of Winterfell, Maester Luwin looking at the stars, Hodor carrying an anvil, Robb practicing with a real sword. The weirwood at Winterfell turns its eyes to look at him knowingly. He sees Catelyn and Ser Rodrik on a galley with a knife; he sees Eddard plead with Robert while Sansa cries and Arya holds her secrets; over them all are two shadows, one dark as ash with the face of a hound and the other armored like the sun, golden and beautiful.1 Over both looms a giant of stone with blood pouring out of his visor.2He looks across the Free Cities and the Dothraki Sea to Vaes Dothrak, and beyond to the Jade Sea to Asshai, where dragons stirred.3 Finally, he looks north and beholds the Wall and Jon and beyond that in the heart of winter something so terrible that it makes him cry. The crow tells him this is why he must live, because winter is coming. He notices that the crow has three eyes. The three-eyed crow pecks at his forehead.4 The ground rushes up to meet him, but he flies at the last second. He awakes in his room in Winterfell. A serving woman runs off to tell everyone that he is awake. He sees his direwolf atop him and is comforted by his warmth. By the time Robb gets to the room, he has decided to name the direwolf Summer.","Catelyn and Ser Rodrik approach King's Landing on Storm Dancer, captained by Moreo Tumitis. Ser Rodrik has been sick for most of the voyage, and finally had to shave his whiskers after befouling them one too many times. Once ashore, they plan to contact Ser Aron Santagar, master-at-arms for the Red Keep, whom they hope can identify the dagger. Ser Rodrik emphasizes the need for secrecy and that there are those at court who would recognize Catelyn on sight. Catelyn realizes he means Littlefinger, Lord Petyr Baelish. He had been a ward to Catelyn's father and a brother to Catelyn herself. He wanted more than that, however, and when he learned that Catelyn was to marry Brandon Stark, he challenged the older man to a duel. Brandon was twenty, Petyr scarcely fifteen, and there was no hope that he could prevail. Catelyn begged Brandon to spare his life, so he left Petyr with only a scar. Catelyn's father sent him away after that. He wrote Catelyn a letter after Brandon was killed, but Catelyn did not read it. Rodrik mentions that Petyr is now on the small council, and Catelyn responds that she always knew he would rise high. They decide that Ser Rodrik will go to the castle and fetch Ser Aron while Catelyn waits for him in a safe place.
Upon going ashore, Catelyn and Ser Rodrik choose an inn recommended by Captain Moreo, and Ser Rodrik departs for the Red Keep. Catelyn falls asleep and wakes to pounding on her door. She opens it to discover men of the City Watch who are under orders to escort her to Lord Petyr. When she arrives, Petyr informs her that he learned of her arrival from Lord Varys, who will join them shortly. Varys went to Petyr because he is master of coin, and most of the small council is gone, with Ser Barristan and Lord Renly off escorting King Robert and Lord Stannis gone to Dragonstone. Also, Varys knew that Petyr was friends with Lysa. Petyr asks why Catelyn is there and is not convinced by her explanation that she wanted to see her husband, as the Tully words are ""Family, Duty, Honor,"" and Catelyn would never leave her assigned post. Varys arrives and asks after the dagger, which he discovered through the ""whispering of little birds"" after Ser Rodrik met with Ser Aron, both of whom left the castle and are waiting for Catelyn at the inn.1 She pulls the dagger out, and Petyr reveals it was his until he lost it at the tournament held on Prince Joffrey's name day when Ser Loras Tyrell unhorsed Ser Jaime Lannister. He says he lost the dagger to Tyrion Lannister.2 3","Jon fights a training match with Grenn, whom he defeats easily. Jeren and Todder drag Grenn off while Ser Alliser Thorne berates Jon for showing fatigue. Ser Alliser has nothing but scorn and hatred for all of the trainees. Ser Alliser ends the training session, and the trainees all go to the armory. Jon also has scorn for all the trainees for their weaknesses and has made no friends. He feels particularly alone as Benjen is gone too. Three days after arriving, he learned that Ben was leading a ranging of six rangers.1 Jon begged him to go along, but Ben refused. The next morning he watched the group leave. Grenn confronts Jon along with Todder and two other recruits2 over the beating in the yard. Jon gets smart with them and a fight breaks out, which is stopped by the blacksmith, Donal Noye. Donal berates Jon for fighting with his brothers. He reminds Jon he is not the only bastard on the wall; Jeren is the bastard of a septon, while Cotter Pyke, commander of Eastwatch by the Sea, is the son of a tavern wench. Jon refuses to acknowledge the trainees as brothers, and Donal reminds him that the Watch is his new life. Jon reflects bitterly that Donal has no place to talk about giving up life. He had smithed for Stannis Baratheon and only came to the wall as an old cripple after losing his arm at the siege of Storm's End. Jon says the other trainees all hate him because he is better than them, and Donal says it is actually because he is a bully, thrashing the others all over the yard and leaving them no dignity. Jon feels ashamed and guilty of his actions.
Jon leaves and stares at the Wall until Tyrion comes by. Jon has not seen him much since arriving, as he is an honored guest of the Lord Commander and spends his time with the officers. Tyrion is surprised that Ghost is not with Jon, and Jon explains that he must keep the wolf chained during training. They discuss Ben, who is long overdue to return from his ranging. He had set out not long after arriving at Castle Black with six rangers to look for Waymar Royce. Many rangers have failed to return from the Far North of late.3 They go to the mess to eat, but Jon is soon summoned by Ser Alliser to see Lord Commander Jeor Mormont. Lord Commander Mormont gives Jon a letter from Robb stating that Bran has woken up and will live, though crippled. Jon is overjoyed and runs back down to the mess to celebrate with Tyrion. He sees Grenn and apologizes to him and offers to help him improve. Ser Alliser scolds Jon for trying to do his job, and Jon mocks him, causing Ser Alliser to leave in a fury.","Eddard arrives at King's Landing and is informed by the king's steward that the small council is meeting and would like him to make an appearance. After leaving instructions with Vayon, he changes and goes to the council chamber, where Lords Renly, Petyr, and Varys and Grand Maester Pycelle are waiting for him. Eddard asks after the other members and is informed that Lord Stannis has left for Dragonstone and that Ser Barristan is guarding Robert. When Eddard suggests waiting for Robert, he is informed that Robert rarely sits in on council meetings. Renly presents a command from Robert stating that he will hold a tournament in Eddard's honor in which the winner receives forty thousand gold dragons, second place receives twenty thousand, the victor of the melee receives another twenty thousand, and the victor of the archery competition receives ten thousand. When Pycelle asks Petyr how this is to be paid for, he says that they will have to borrow from Lord Tywin because the treasury is empty. The crown is over six million gold pieces in debt, with the largest part owed to Lord Tywin and the rest owed to Lord Tyrell, the Iron Bank of Braavos, several Tyroshi trading cartels, and even the Faith. Eddard is stunned, as Aerys II had left a treasury flowing with gold, and cannot believe that Lord Jon would have let Robert beggar the realm. Pycelle says that Robert often disregarded Jon's advice. Eddard means to convince the king to call the tournament off, but the other counselors tell him it will be a futile gesture. Eddard angrily calls a halt to the meeting, saying he is tired from the journey, and leaves.
Eddard watches the king's party make its way into the castle. Eddard stayed at the head of the column after the incident on the Trident, while Robert confined himself to the wheelhouse and stayed perpetually drunk. Sansa blames Arya for what happened to Lady, while Arya has brooded silently since the death of Mycah. Petyr approaches Eddard as he is heading back to his rooms and bids him follow in another direction. When Eddard asks where they are going, Petyr only tells him that his wife is waiting for him. They go out the castle and climb down a hidden ladder carved into the cliff. At the bottom, they mount horses and ride to a brothel that Petyr owns, and Petyr tells Eddard that his wife is within. Eddard is angered when he realizes they have come to a brothel and insults Petyr, but Ser Rodrik appears and assures him that Petyr is telling the truth.
They go inside and meet Catelyn, and she explains all she knows about Bran and the dagger. Eddard wants to accuse Cersei, but Petyr says there is not enough proof and they best be rid of the dagger.1 Catelyn has also told Petyr about their suspicions over the death of Lord Jon, and he has agreed to help in the search for the killer. Catelyn fears Varys, but Petyr says he has him in check. After all is told, Eddard orders Catelyn and Ser Rodrik to ride back to Winterfell. He tells Catelyn to order Helman Tallhart and Galbart Glover to each post two hundred bowmen at Moat Cailin to hold the Neck and for Lord Wyman Manderly to fortify White Harbor. Furthermore, he orders Theon closely watched, as they may need House Greyjoy's fleet. He feels there will not be war, but he must not show weakness. When he has all the evidence he needs, he plans to go to Robert and expose the Lannister treachery.","Tyrion is taking dinner with the high officers of the Night's Watch, including Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, Ser Alliser Thorne, Bowen Marsh, Ser Jaremy Rykker, and Maester Aemon, and informs Jeor that he will be leaving on the morrow. He mocks Ser Alliser, who gets up and leaves. Tyrion comments that Ser Alliser is not fit to be master-at-arms, but Lord Commander Mormont laments that they have too few knights or trained fighters. Few knights have taken the black during Mormont's tenure as Lord Commander, and Ser Alliser fought bravely at King's Landing. Ser Jaremy quips that he and Ser Alliser were on the wrong side in that battle, and afterward Lord Tywin gave them the choice of taking the black or dying as traitors. Mormont accuses Tyrion of mocking the Watch, but Maester Aemon says that Tyrion is a giant come amongst them, which leaves Tyrion speechless.
After dinner, Jeor drinks with Tyrion. He tells Tyrion that he will give him an escort as far as Winterfell. Tyrion protests that he has his own men, Jyck and Morrec, and that Yoren is going south again too, but Mormont insists. Tyrion suggests sending Jon, but Mormont thinks that seeing his family again will just stir up feelings that are best left buried at this phase of his training. Mormont adds that his sister, Maege, rules Bear Island with his son's dishonor, and he has nieces he has never met. Lord Commander Mormont goes on to talk about the Watch's plight. The Watch is dying. There are less than one thousand men now; six hundred at Castle Black, two hundred at the Shadow Tower, and slightly less than that at Eastwatch, and only one-third of these are fighting men. He regrets sending Ser Waymar out on a ranging with him so green, but he feared to offend his father, Lord Yohn Royce. He sent two of his most reliable men with Waymar, and was shocked when Eddard sent him Gared's head after he was executed as a deserter. He laments the fact that Ben Stark has gone missing and wonders whom he should send to find him. Finally, he laments his own old age, sixty-eight, and worries that there are no suitable successors to his position. He pleads with Tyrion to tell Lord Tywin and King Robert of the Watch's needs. Jeor is desperate because the findings of the Citadel indicate that winter is on the way and it will be a bad one. He has reports from Denys Mallister of the Shadow Tower that wildlings are slipping south in greater numbers than usual, apparently running from something, and the fisherfolk of Eastwatch have glimpsed strange things.
Tyrion takes his leave and is heading back to his chambers when he suddenly gets the urge to climb the Wall one last time. He gets to the top and walks west, meeting Jon and Ghost. Jon has been making progress with his fellow trainees. Grenn is better than he was, and he has starting helping another trainee named Pypar too. Ser Alliser has taken a special interest in making his life hell. Tyrion tells Jon that he is stopping by Winterfell on the way south and asks if there is a message he would like sent. He tells Tyrion to help Bran like he helped him. They shake hands as friends, and gaze off to the edge of the world.","Eddard arrives at dinner late after a small council meeting. He joins Sansa, Arya, Septa Mordane, Jeyne, Hullen, Jory and most of his fifty guards, including Desmond, Jacks, Harwin, and Porther. Eddard tells them about the upcoming tournament, and Sansa gets excited. Eddard does not want his daughters to come, but Sansa pleads and Septa Mordane points out that it would seem odd if his daughters did not attend a tournament in his honor. Arya starts thinking about Mycah and Lady and loses her appetite. She runs from the table, darts past Tomard, and locks herself in her room. She takes out Needle and holds it. Eddard comes to her door, and Arya opens it to admit him. He sees Needle in her hand. He laments that she has ""the wolf blood,"" like both Brandon and Lyanna, and says it led them both to an early grave. He believes Lyanna would have carried a sword if allowed to. Arya confesses that she blames herself for Mycah's death and also that she and Jory drove Nymeria away by throwing rocks so she would not be killed. Eddard tells her that they have enemies in King's Landing and that she must stop feuding with Sansa and show a united front, and Arya agrees to try to be less willful. Eddard gives Needle back and leaves. The next day, Vayon brings her to the small hall, where Syrio Forel, who had been the first sword of the Sealord of Braavos for nine years, is waiting for her to begin her instruction in the art of swordfighting.","Drogo's party reaches the edge of the Dothraki Sea. Daenerys is riding with her entourage, including Ser Jorah, Irri, her khas (bodyguard),1 and Viserys. Illyrio had counseled Viserys not to make the journey and offered the comfort of his manse, but Viserys refused to leave Drogo's side until he receives his promised crown. A sudden impulse takes Daenerys, and she decides to ride out into the grasses of the Dothraki Sea, leaving orders with Ser Jorah for no one to follow her. Daenerys thinks back on her journey thus far. The journey was not easy for Daenerys at first. Riding on horseback all day has left her sore and bloody. Drogo's lovemaking at night made it even worse. She was almost ready to kill herself when she had a dream of being purified by dragonfire. From that point on, she became stronger and more confident. She also took an interest in the beauty of the land around her. The party made their way through the hills around Norvos, past villages of white stucco, forded four rivers, traveled down ancient Valyrian roads, and passed through the Forest of Qohor.
Daenerys's reverie is interrupted when a furious Viserys rides out to scold her for having Ser Jorah command him not to intrude, but Daenerys stands up for herself and shoves him away. Viserys is about to respond when Jhogo rides up and coils his whip around Viserys's neck. When Daenerys sees him on the ground red-faced and sobbing, she realizes what a pitiful creature he really is. She orders his horse taken away, a dreadful insult and humiliation amongst the Dothraki. Daenerys is afraid afterward that she has woken the dragon and that Viserys will hurt her later, but Ser Jorah tells her that Rhaegar was the last dragon and Viserys is merely the shadow of a snake. She realizes that he would make a terrible king and that he will never retake the Seven Kingdoms. Back at camp, she notices that her stone dragon eggs are unusually warm.2 As Irri, Jhiqui, and Doreah bathe her, she asks about dragons, but they tell her they are all gone. Daenerys recalls that Viserys told her the last Targaryen dragons had died a century and a half ago during the reign of Aegon III, who was given the epitaph Dragonbane. That night she talks with Doreah late into the night about sex, and when Drogo comes, she pleases him so thoroughly that he calls out her name at his climax. When they are on the far side of the Dothraki Sea some time later, Daenerys, now fourteen, realizes she is pregnant.","Bran watches Rickon run in the yard with Summer, Grey Wind, and Shaggydog. Bran is now eight and having trouble coping with his paralysis. Old Nan is with him to take care of him and keep him company. Nan is the oldest person in Winterfell. She came to be a wetnurse for another Brandon whose mother died giving birth, though whether this Brandon was a brother of Lord Rickard or of Lord Rickard's father1 changes depending on when Nan tells the story. At any rate, the boy died of a chill at three, but Nan stayed on at the castle. Her two sons died during Robert's Rebellion and her grandson died during Greyjoy's Rebellion, while her daughters long ago married, moved away, and died. Her only kin left is the stableboy, Hodor. Robb spends all his time now trying to be a lord, drilling the guard, going over accounts, and visiting outlying holdfasts.
Bran is cranky and in no mood for Old Nan's stories. She offers to tell the story of Brandon the Builder and how he raised both Winterfell and the Wall, but Bran says he prefers the scary stories. Nan therefore proceeds to tell Bran a story of the Others. Many thousands of years ago, a winter came that was the harshest ever experienced and a night came that lasted a generation. It was then that the Others came. They rolled over all in their path, defeating armies by the score. As all hope seemed lost, the last hero rode forth into the Far North with a sword, a horse, a dog, and a dozen companions to find the children of the forest and magic to defeat the Others. After years of fruitless searching, all of the hero's companions died and his sword shattered and the Others closed in on him with packs of pale white spiders the size of hounds. Just as Nan reaches the climax of the story, Maester Luwin comes in with Hodor and tells Bran he is required in the great hall to meet Tyrion, who has just arrived.
Hodor carries Bran to the hall, where Robb, flanked by Theon, Hallis, and a dozen guards, is talking to Tyrion, his servants,2 Yoren, and three other members of the Night's Watch. Robb is rude to Tyrion and threatens him as Bran enters the room. Tyrion asks Bran if he remembers how he happened to fall, but he cannot. He then gives the boy a gift, telling him that he can ride a horse using a special saddle of Tyrion's design. Suddenly, Rickon and the three direwolves burst into the room, and the direwolves proceed to attack Tyrion until they are called off. Robb apologizes for his earlier rudeness and offers Tyrion chambers in the castle, but Tyrion takes his leave to find an inn in town, and Robb turns his attention to Yoren while Bran goes back to his room. He falls asleep and has a dream relating to his fall in which he desperately states that he did not hear Cersei and Jaime's conversation. At dinner with the Watch members, Yoren reports Ben's disappearance. After the feast, Robb sits in Bran's room and cries for fear and grief.","Lord Eddard questions Grand Maester Pycelle on the death of Jon Arryn. It is extremely hot, causing Pycelle to comment that the smallfolk claim the last year of summer is always the hottest. He goes on to say that King Maekar's summer was even hotter and had even some in the Citadel claiming that the Great Summer, the summer that never ends, had come at last, but it broke in the seventh year and was followed by a long, harsh winter. Jon had come to Pycelle asking after a certain book one day, and the very next day, he had a terrible stomach illness. His Maester, Colemon, was purging his stomach, and Pycelle sent him away because he feared it might kill Jon.1 He often called out Robert's name in his final days, and his last words were ""the seed is strong.""2 Eddard suggests he may have been poisoned, but Pycelle discounts it, saying that he has been Grand Maester for nearly forty years under Robert, Aerys II, Aerys's father Jaehaerys II, and even Jaehaerys's father Aegon V and did not think Jon's illness was suspicious. Eddard mentions Lady Lysa's accusations that poison was the culprit, but Pycelle counters that while poisonings are common in the Free Cities, the poisoner has always been held in contempt in the Seven Kingdoms as recorded by Grand Maester Aethelmure. When Eddard mentions that poison is a woman's weapon, Pycelle counters that it is also the weapon of eunuchs and warns Eddard not to trust Varys. Eddard prepares to take his leave and asks Pycelle to send him the book Jon was reading, a book of genealogies written by Grand Maester Malleon. Eddard asks if Cersei was with Jon when he died, and Pycelle reports that she and her children were journeying to Casterly Rock when it happened, escorting Lord Tywin who had come to the city to see the tournament held on Joffrey's name day.
On the way back to his chambers, Eddard sees Arya practicing balancing, and they talk about Bran, whom they have just learned has woken up. Arya asks if he can still be a knight, and Eddard tells her that he cannot but may still be a great lord and councilor. Arya asks if she can raise castles and be a councilor too and is disappointed with Eddard's answer that she cannot. Eddard returns to his rooms, and Alyn comes to inform him that Lord Petyr requests an audience. He has been doing his own investigating and discovered that four members of Jon's household remained after Lysa fled to the Eyrie, a pregnant kitchen girl, a stablehand who joined the City Watch, a potboy discharged for theft, and Jon's squire, Ser Hugh of the Vale, who was knighted by the king after Jon's death. Eddard says he will call on the squire, and Petyr shows him two spies, one from Varys and one from Cersei, that keep him under watch. He tells Eddard he should send a man he trusts instead. Eddard tells Petyr he was wrong not to trust him, but Petyr rejoins that not trusting him was one of the few smart things he has done since coming to King's Landing.","Jon is instructing Dareon and Pyp when a new recruit, Samwell Tarly, enters the practice yard. He is immensely fat and very nervous. Ser Alliser immediately mocks him as Ser Piggy. After he is outfitted, Ser Alliser orders Halder to test him. He is felled quickly, but Ser Alliser orders Halder to press the attack again. Jon tells Halder to stop, which infuriates Ser Alliser. He tells two other recruits, Rast and Albett, nicknamed Rat and Pimple respectively, to join Halder in attacking Jon and Sam. Pyp and Grenn immediately come to Jon's aid. After the battle, Sam thanks them. When they ask why he did not fight back, he tells them he is a coward, which shocks the boys. Sam walks away forlorn, and Jon goes to put up his armor.
Life for the trainees at Castle Black revolves around training in the morning and work in the afternoon. The trainees are set to a variety of tasks to discover their strengths. These activities include hunting for game, working at the forge with Donal Noye, running messages, standing guard, mucking out stables, fletching arrows, assisting Maester Aemon with the ravens, and aiding Bowen Marsh with his accounting. That day, Jon is tasked with spreading crushed gravel over the top of the Wall to make it less slippery, and he thinks of Sam as he works and how it takes a certain kind of courage to admit cowardice. At dinner, Jon and the others listen to Pyp, who had been an actor, tell a story, but Jon takes his leave to join Sam, who is sitting alone. They go outside and talk. Ghost joins them, and Sam is frightened initially, but the wolf seems to like him. Jon tells Sam the story of how he found the direwolves in the snow and soon begins talking about Winterfell, revealing he is having a recurring dream in which he wanders the halls of the castle looking for Eddard or Robb or Arya or Benjen. Ben is still missing. Lord Commander Mormont is still searching for him, with Ser Jaremy leading two sweeps and Qhorin Halfhand searching from the Shadow Tower, but they have found no trace of Ben, only the blazes in the trees he left to mark his way, which suddenly vanish in the highlands of the northwest.
Jon wonders why a self-proclaimed coward would join the Watch, and Sam explains how his father, Lord Randyll, was always disappointed in him as an heir, because he is fond of dancing and reading and not fond of martial pursuits, and that after another son, Dickon, was finally born after Sam was followed by three girls, Randyll gave Sam the choice of joining the Night's Watch or dying in an accident. Jon tells Sam they should return to the hall and listen to Dareon sing. He was an apprentice singer until he was discovered in bed with the daughter of Lord Mathis Rowan of Goldengrove, who Dareon claims consented but named it rape when her father found out. Sam declines and goes to get some sleep, so Jon returns alone and joins Pyp, Toad, Halder, Grenn, Jeren, Dareon, Rast, and Albett and tells them not to hurt Sam during practice. All agree except Rast, so Jon goes to his room that night with Grenn, Pyp, and Ghost and frightens him into agreeing. After several days, Sam works up the courage to join them and interact with them. When he comes to thank Jon and call him friend, Jon says they are not friends, but brothers.","Janos Slynt, Commander of the City Watch, makes a report to the small council on the state of the city. With all the knights coming to take part in the tournament, the city is full of crime and unrest. He specifically mentions a woman's head found in the rainbow pool at the Great Sept, causing Varys to shudder. Eddard orders the hiring of fifty new watchmen and loans the watch twenty of his own men. After Janos takes his leave, Eddard once again vents his disgust at the tournament. Pycelle replies that the realm benefits by giving the great a chance for glory and the lowborn a respite from their woes. Petyr adds that the inns and whorehouses also prosper, causing Renly to bring up the time Stannis tried to outlaw brothels. He further wonders how Stannis ever conceived his ugly daughter,1 as he approaches his marriage bed as if he were going into battle.
After the meeting, Eddard returns to his chambers and tells Harwin to fetch Jory. As he waits, he peruses the tome that Jon was reading when he died, The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms by Grand Maester Malleon. The book is over a century old, and Eddard has trouble seeing how it can be important. He turns to the section on House Lannister, which traces its lineage back to Lann the Clever, a legendary trickster from the Age of Heroes who supposedly tricked House Casterly into giving him Casterly Rock and stole gold from the sun to brighten his curly hair. When Jory arrives, Eddard tells him to pick the men for the city watch and give Alyn the command. Jory has been questioning Jon's servants that are still in the city. Ser Hugh was arrogant and refused to answer questions for a captain of the guard, the serving girl said nothing of interest, the potboy mentioned that Jon had gone to see an armorer with Stannis, and the stableboy talked of Jon and Stannis visiting a brothel together. Eddard is curious as to why Jon and Stannis spent so much time together, as they were not friends. He also wonders why Stannis remains at Dragonstone and what could frighten a man who once held Storm's End for a year against the might of House Tyrell and House Redwyne while forced to subsist on rats and shoe leather. Eddard is also uneasy about Renly. Several days before, Renly showed him a picture of Margaery Tyrell and asked if she looked like Lyanna. He seemed disappointed when Eddard said no.2
Eddard has decided to visit the armorer that Jon and Stannis visited, as he had never known Jon to be interested in fancy armor. He has Jory begin searching brothels to discover which one Jon and Stannis visited. He rides with Varly and Jacks. Earlier that morning, he had sent Desmond and Tomard to scout his route and make sure he is not followed. As they pass the River Gate, they see Lord Beric Dondarrion arriving to take part in the tournament. They arrive at the house of the armorer, Tobho Mott, and Eddard proceeds to question him about Jon's visit. He learns that Jon and Stannis came to see a boy, and he asks to see him as well. The boy is named Gendry. Gendry is carrying a bull's head helmet that Eddard offers to buy, but he says he made it for himself and it is not for sale. Tobho prepares to punish him for insolence, but Eddard moves on, asking what he talked about with Jon. Jon asked about his mother, a worker in an alehouse. Stannis watched everything, but said nothing. Eddard dismisses Gendry and then asks Mott who paid Gendry's apprentice fee. Mott at first tries to deny that anyone did, but finally admits it was a short, stout lord with a brown beard that kept his face hidden.3 Eddard takes his leave, wondering why Jon had taken an interest in one of the king's bastards.","Catelyn and Ser Rodrik are on the road back to Winterfell. It is raining heavily, and they decide to stay at an inn for the night. It is an inn Catelyn stayed at many times in her youth, run by a fat woman named Masha Heddle. Lord Jason Mallister, his son Patrek, and a contingent of knights pass them on the road. Lord Jason is a bannerman to Catelyn's father, but he does not recognize her because she is so disheveled. They take rooms at the inn. Once in her room, Catelyn glances out at the crossroads and ponders what to do next. If she turns west, she can be at Riverrun quickly to warn Lord Hoster of the coming danger. She would take that course of action, except Hoster has been bedridden for two years. To the east, the road passes through the Mountains of the Moon to the Vale of Arryn and the Eyrie, where Lysa may have proof that could bring down House Lannister. That route is extremely dangerous, with both predators and hostile mountain clans blocking the way, and only well-armed parties have a chance of making the journey safely. Catelyn decides she must wait until she is back in the North and then send riders. She thinks of her father's bannermen, House Blackwood and House Bracken constantly in feud, Lady Shella Whent of Harrenhal, the last of her line,1 and Lord Walder Frey, who has outlived seven wives. She wonders how many are truly loyal to Riverrun, as when Lord Hoster called the banners during Robert's Rebellion, House Darry, House Ryger, and House Mooton fought for House Targaryen and Lord Walder held back his strength until after the decisive battle on the Trident, leading Hoster to label him the Late Lord Frey.
Catelyn and Ser Rodrik return to the common room for dinner and decide to masquerade as father and daughter. A singer named Marillion strikes up a conversation with them. He asks who the greatest singer they know is, and when Rodrik answers Alia of Braavos, he claims he is far better. Just then, Tyrion enters with Jyck, Morrec, and Yoren and asks for rooms. He is not glancing in Catelyn's direction, but Marillion leaps up to get his attention, and Tyrion sees her and calls her by name. Catelyn gets up and turns to an older man in the service of House Whent2 and asks if he is loyal to Riverrun. He replies in the affirmative. Next, she turns to three men-at-arms of House Bracken3 and courts their loyalty as well. Finally she turns to a group of Frey men-at-arms and asks the same. When all is settled, she formally accuses Tyrion of conspiring to murder Bran and orders him seized in the name of King Robert.4","Sansa goes to the Hand's tournament with Septa Mordane and Jeyne Poole. Participants in the tournament include all seven Kingsguard;1 Ser Gregor Clegane, called the Mountain That Rides; Lord Yohn Royce, whose armor is thousands of years old and covered in runes that supposedly protect him from harm; his sons Ser Andar and Ser Robar; Lord Jason Mallister, who slew three of Prince Rhaegar's bannermen on the Trident; his son Patrek; Thoros of Myr, who wields a flaming sword and scaled the walls of Pyke during Greyjoy's Rebellion; Ser Balon Swann; Lord Bryce Caron; the twins Ser Hobber and Ser Horas Redwyne; six Freys, Ser Jared, Ser Emmon, Ser Hosteen, Ser Danwell, Ser Perwyn, and Ser Theo;2 Martyn Rivers; Jalabhar Xho, an exiled prince from the Summer Isles; Lord Beric Dondarrion; Sandor Clegane; Lord Renly Baratheon; Jory Cassel; Harwin; Alyn; Lothor Brune; Ser Aron Santagar; and Ser Loras Tyrell.
Sansa thoroughly enjoys the whole affair, and her enthusiasm is not dimmed even when Gregor's lance spears one of his challengers in the neck, killing him.3 By the end of the day, only four riders remain; Sandor, Gregor, Jaime, and Loras. Loras has been giving a woman in the crowd a white rose after every victory. After his final victory, he rides up to Sansa and gives her a red rose, leaving her speechless.4 Afterward, Lord Petyr talks to her and touches her briefly before turning away. That night, there is a feast at which Sansa is seated next to Joffrey, whom she has not spoken to since the incident on the Trident, but he is polite and disarming. She is lost in the magical evening as multiple food courses go by and singers and Moon Boy perform.
During the evening, King Robert gets increasingly more drunk and ever louder until he finally interrupts the whole banquet by telling Cersei that he will fight in the melee whether she likes it or not. Cersei leaves in a huff and Robert shoves Jaime aside when the knight tries to reason with him. Joffrey asks Sansa if she would like an escort back to the castle. When she says yes, he summons Sandor to take her. She tries complimenting him on his riding and addresses him as a knight, but both acts anger him. He is disdainful of knights and their vows. He is drunk and mocks her and says that Gregor killed the knight earlier in the day on purpose. He makes Sansa look at his hideous face and tells her that Gregor burned it in a brazier when they were younger because Sandor had taken a toy knight of his and was playing with it. Four years later, Prince Rhaegar made Gregor a knight. When they get back to Sansa's rooms, he tells her that if she ever tells anyone what he just told her, he will kill her.","Ser Barristan and Eddard converse over the body of Ser Hugh as the silent sisters attend to the corpse. Eddard wonders if he was killed by the Lannisters before he could talk. Barristan says Hugh was Jon's squire for four years and desperately wanted a knighthood, but he was not ready. The two head to King Robert's tent, where he is preparing to fight in the melee. His two squires1 are trying to get him into his armor, but he is too fat. Eddard points this out, and Robert sends the squires looking for a breastplate stretcher. Eddard is troubled by the fact that the squires are both Lannisters. Ser Barristan tells Robert as a ploy to get him to stand down that if he fights, no one would dare strike him, and Robert throws a breastplate at him in fury and orders him out. He tells Eddard to stay and laments to him about how dead he feels. He only became king instead of Jon or Eddard because his claim was better.2 He married Cersei to tie Lord Tywin to him, but gets no joy from marriage. He would just leave for the Free Cities and work as a mercenary if he were not so worried about Joffrey taking the throne. He is hopeful that with Eddard at his side he can turn around his admittedly poor reign. He also mentions that Renly told him about Loras's sister and how beautiful she is.3 Robert's melancholy lifts at breakfast, and Eddard becomes confident that once he proves the Lannisters were behind Jon's death the king will crush them.
Eddard joins Sansa to watch the rest of the tournament as Sandor and Jaime take their places. Petyr and Renly make wagers on who will win. Sandor unseats Jaime on the second tilt, and Renly laments Tyrion's absence, for he would have won twice as much.4 As Gregor and Loras take their places for the second match, Eddard contemplates the Mountain That Rides. He is a solitary man who only leaves his lands for wars and tournaments. He will soon be married a third time, and both of his previous wives, as well as his sister and father, died under strange circumstances. The day he inherited his father's lands, Sandor left to take service with the Lannisters as a sworn sword and never returned. Rumor has it that it was Gregor who killed Rhaegar's infant son, Aegon, by dashing his head against a wall and that he raped and killed Elia afterward. He also fought in Greyjoy's Rebellion. Ser Loras unseats Gregor with the aid of a mare in heat that distracts Gregor's horse. Gregor is furious and calls for his sword, which his squire fetches.5 He kills his own horse before knocking Ser Loras from his saddle. Before he can land the killing blow, Sandor is there and stops him. They fight until Robert puts a stop to it. A shaken Loras cedes the final match to Sandor, who wins the champion's prize. Later, a boy from the Dornish Marches named Anguy wins the archery competition by defeating Ser Balon Swann and Jalabhar Xho in the final round. Finally, in a free-for-all melee of forty men, Thoros of Myr wins the last prize of the day. At the feast that night, Jory brings Arya down fresh from a training session with Syrio Forel and with bruises. Eddard worries that Syrio is pushing her too much. He has her do strange things like walk around blindfolded and catch cats. He asks her if she would like a new tutor, but she says no.
Back in his chambers, Eddard muses about Jon's death. He feels it has to be related to Bran's fall,6 and he wonders what is so significant about Gendry. Robert has many other bastards as well, including his first, a seventeen year old girl in the Vale,7 and one acknowledged bastard being raised at Storm's End.8 Harwin interrupts his musings to report that a man who will not identify himself is there to see him. The man ends up being Lord Varys, dressed up in such a way that he is unrecognizable. He had gotten past two other guards, Porther and Cayn, by using secret passages within the castle. He has come to ally himself with Eddard against the Lannisters for the good of the realm. He reveals that Cersei had planned to have Robert killed during the melee, but Eddard thwarted that. He did not come to Eddard before because he was not certain if he truly served the realm until that point. He says Cersei is afraid of Eddard and will undoubtedly try to kill Robert again. He reveals that both Ser Boros and Ser Meryn are her creatures and that the only protection that Eddard has is that he is virtually untouchable because of his friendship with Robert. He hopes that his spies and Eddard's power will be enough to forestall the Lannisters. Eddard asks Varys how Jon was killed, and Varys reveals it was with the Tears of Lys. When Eddard asks who did it, Varys replies that it must have been someone close to him, perhaps even Hugh.9 When Eddard asks why, Varys says it was because Jon was asking questions.","Tyrion watches Chiggen butcher his horse and endures taunts from Bronn. The horse was a gift from Jaime for his twenty-third birthday. He walks off and thinks back on the events that got him into this predicament. When Catelyn called on the patrons of the inn to arrest Tyrion, Jyck drew his sword, but Tyrion quickly stopped him and realized that he had to surrender to Catelyn to have any chance of survival. Yoren stood aside as Catelyn took him into custody, as the Watch does not involve itself in the quarrels of the realm. Masha begged Catelyn not to kill him in her inn, and Catelyn said she would take him back to Winterfell. Tyrion told the assembled that Lord Tywin will pay handsomely for word of what happened, and he was confident of rescue. Ser Rodrik decreed that they would take Jyck and Morrec too. Catelyn asked for volunteers to guard him, and Ser Willis Wode, Kurleket, Lharys, Mohor, Bronn, and Chiggen stepped forward. Marillion also decided to come along so he could compose a song of the ""splendid adventure."" They blindfolded Tyrion and began the journey. When they took off his blindfold at the end of the first day, he realized that they were not going to Winterfell, but were in fact taking the high road to the Vale of Arryn.
Catelyn has set a relentless pace through the mountains, and they have lost three horses. Ser Rodrik counsels a slower pace, and Tyrion seconds that thought, adding that he may not survive such a rough pace. He once again denies trying to murder Bran and tells Catelyn that Lord Petyr is a liar and brags to all and sundry that he took Catelyn's maidenhead.1 Before he can tell more, a group of mountain clansmen approach their position. Tyrion tells Catelyn to arm him and his men, which she does reluctantly. They successfully drive off the clansmen, who leave nine dead on the field. Their losses are only three, Jyck, Kurleket, and Mohor. Ser Rodrik is wounded. As the fight nears its end, Tyrion saves Catelyn's life. Ser Willis counsels riding on, as the clansmen will certainly be back. Catelyn wants to stay and bury the dead, but she is soon dissuaded from that folly. She allows Tyrion to keep his weapons. As they set out again, Tyrion rides up to Catelyn and continues to tell her why he is innocent. Petyr claimed that Tyrion won the dagger betting against Jaime, but Tyrion never bets against his family.2","Arya is chasing an old black tomcat around the Red Keep.1 Syrio has had her chasing cats night and day, and she has caught every single one in the castle save this one. She finally catches the cat when she is startled by the appearance of Prince Tommen and Princess Myrcella accompanied by a septa2 and two guards. They mistake her for a boy, and the septa orders one of the guards, Godwyn, to seize her. She darts away and manages to avoid them all, but ends up in an unfamiliar part of the castle. When her eyes adjust to the dark, she discovers she is in a storeroom containing the dragons that used to hang in the throne room. She proceeds down a dark hallway until she hears voices and sees two men coming up steps from below. One is a scarred man who seems strangely familiar and the other is a fat man with a forked yellow beard.3 Yellowbeard tells Scarface that he must delay until the khal is ready to stir, which he will not do until his child is born.4 Scarface says that Eddard already has the bastard and the book and will soon know the truth.5 This combined with the attempt on his son and Catelyn's seizure of Tyrion means that the Starks and Lannisters will soon be at each other's throats and that the Tullys will probably be dragged in too. Furthermore, Lysa and Stannis have fled beyond Scarface's reach and are gathering swords, while Loras is writing his father to bring his sister to court so that Robert can wed and bed her, and Petyr remains unpredictable as always. Yellowbeard suggests killing Eddard, but Scarface says that is untenable. Scarface says they must move now, but Yellowbeard says this is impossible. Scarface ends by asking for fifty more ""little birds,"" young boys who can read and write but have their tongues removed.6 After that, they are out of hearing range, but Arya follows their torch to get out of the passage. She ends up at the mouth of a sewer far from the castle and has to walk back. The guards at the gate almost do not let her in. Finally, Tomard and Harwin march her in to see Eddard. She tries to tell him what she heard, but gets it all mixed up in her head, and he thinks she just saw a mummer's troupe. Desmond interrupts their conversation to announce Yoren, who has just arrived in King's Landing. Yoren asks to speak to Eddard in private,7 and Eddard has Desmond lead Arya away. On the way to her room, she asks Desmond if the guards will be able to protect Eddard. Desmond says yes, each northerner is worth ten southron swords.","Varys has just told the small council that Ser Jorah has informed him Daenerys is pregnant. Robert wants to kill her and Viserys now, but Eddard is protesting heatedly. He says there is no threat, as the Dothraki will never cross the sea, but Robert thinks his reign is in danger. Renly says they should have killed Viserys and Daenerys years ago, but Lord Jon always managed to convince Robert not to. Eddard points out how mercy can be useful, reminding Robert that Ser Barristan killed over a dozen men on the Trident yet when he was brought before Robert near death and Roose Bolton urged that his throat be cut, Robert pardoned him instead. Eddard argues well past the point of reason, calling Robert a coward and an ignoble king, but in the end is outvoted, with Renly, Petyr, Varys, and Pycelle voting for and only Barristan joining Eddard in voting against assassination. Renly suggests having Jorah do the deed, but Varys says that will not work, for the Dothraki would kill him, so he will refuse. Varys suggests using the tears of Lys, and Pycelle looks at him suspiciously.1 Eddard refuses to be party to the murder and resigns his position as Hand of the King. Robert tells him to go back to Winterfell or he will have Eddard's head. As Eddard leaves, Pycelle brings up hiring the Faceless Men of Braavos, but Petyr complains they are too expensive. Eddard passes Ser Boros on his way out of the council chamber.
Back in his chambers, Eddard summons Vayon and has him prepare for the journey back to Winterfell. He decides he will leave first with his daughters and a few guardsmen and the rest of the household can follow behind. He contemplates going by ship to see Stannis, as he is convinced Stannis knows the secret that Jon died for. He has sent a letter to Dragonstone asking Stannis to return to his council seat but has received no reply. Eddard sends Vayon to look for a ship right before Tomard announces that Petyr is there to see him. Petyr tells Eddard that they have decided not to hire a Faceless Man and will just let it be known that a lordship awaits anyone who kills Daenerys. He then tells Eddard that if he will delay his departure briefly, he will take Eddard to the brothel he has been searching for.2","Catelyn and her party are being escorted by Ser Donnel Waynwood and a party from the Vale. Two more of Catelyn's men, Lharys and Chiggen, died in a second clansmen attack, and Morrec died soon after when his wounds festered. When Ser Donnel approached, they drew up for a last stand before realizing who it was. The clans have been bold since Lord Jon died, and Lysa has pulled all her men into the Vale of Arryn, refusing to let them leave, even for the Hand's tournament. Catelyn asks for Maester Colemon to tend to Ser Rodrik's wounds, but he is commanded to stay at the Eyrie at all times and care for Lord Robert. They approach the Bloody Gate, and Ser Brynden Tully rides out to greet them. They pass through the gate and leave Ser Willis and Ser Rodrik, both wounded, before continuing on. Marillion and Bronn ask to continue on with her and Tyrion and she allows it.
On the way, Catelyn tells Brynden all that has occurred. She thinks how her uncle was always a good listener, except when it came to her father, whom he quarreled with often. When Catelyn was eight, Lord Hoster called Brynden the black goat of House Tully, and Brynden retorted he should be a black fish since the Tully symbol is a trout. He took a black fish for his personal emblem and has been known as the Blackfish ever since. They continued to fight until the day Lysa wed and Brynden left to take service with Lord Jon. Brynden is worried by Catelyn's story. The nobles of the Vale are angry that Jaime Lannister has been named Warden of the East and many suspect Jon was murdered. Lord Robert is sickly and weak and many feel that Lord Nestor Royce, who ruled the Vale for fourteen years as High Steward while Lord Jon was serving as Hand, should rule until he comes of age, while others believe Lysa must marry again. She has already rejected a dozen suitors. Brynden also says that Lysa may not be helpful. She is changed by hard years, including two stillbirths and four miscarriages. They ride to the Gates of the Moon, where Lord Nestor greets them. He says that Lady Lysa has asked that Catelyn be sent up right away despite the fact that it is after dark. A young woman, Mya Stone, will take her to the top. Tyrion is escorted to a cell at the Gates.
Catelyn starts her climb, which takes her past three waycastles as the journey continues, Stone, Snow, and Sky. Mya talks as they go, telling Catelyn how she is in love with Ser Lyn Corbray's squire, Mychel Redfort, and that they are to marry when he becomes a knight in a year or two. Catelyn thinks to herself that House Redfort is one of the oldest houses in the Vale, tracing their lineage back to the First Men, and that a son of this house would never marry a bastard.1 The path gets narrower and windier on up, and by the time Catelyn reaches the last waycastle, Sky, she is too nervous to continue and has herself hauled up from Sky to the Eyrie in a basket. She is greeted by Ser Vardis Egen and Maester Colemon, who take her to Lysa. Her sister is all smiles until everyone leaves, at which point she turns vicious. She is furious that Catelyn brought Tyrion to the Vale and dragged her into her quarrel with the Lannisters. She had never meant to fight them, only to hide in the Eyrie. Lord Robert comes in as she shouts, and he is very sickly. He gets scared, and Lysa breastfeeds him. She wonders what to do with Tyrion, and Robert asks if they can make him fly.2","Eddard prepares to leave the brothel, run by Chataya, with Lord Petyr, Jory, Heward, and Wyl. He found another bastard of Robert's at the brothel, a baby girl named Barra, who has fine dark hair. They begin the ride back to the Red Keep. Eddard thinks of Lyanna. She once told him that Robert would never keep to one bed, and when Eddard protested that Robert loved her, she responded that love could not change a man's nature. Eddard asks Petyr what he knows of Robert's bastards. Petyr does not know how many Robert has, but says there is one acknowledged bastard that he begot with a Florent on the night Stannis wed his wife.1 When the boy was born, Robert shipped him to Renly at Storm's End. There are also rumors that he had twins with a serving girl at Casterly Rock three years ago when he attended Lord Tywin's tourney and that Cersei had the babies killed and the mother sold into slavery.2 Eddard asks Petyr why Lord Jon would take an interest in Robert's bastards and why someone would kill him for it. Petyr finds the idea preposterous. Eddard suddenly thinks of Rhaegar and wonders if the prince ever visited brothels. He believes the prince did not. Suddenly, Eddard and Petyr are surrounded by twenty Lannister house guards led by Jaime. Jaime asks after Tyrion, and Eddard says he has been taken at his order to answer for his crimes. Jaime tells Petyr to leave, and Petyr promises to bring the City Watch. Jaime prepares to kill Eddard, but Eddard reminds Jaime that this would lead Catelyn to kill Tyrion. Jaime realizes this is so and tells the commander of his guards, Tregar, to make sure Eddard comes to no harm. He then orders Tregar to kill Eddard's men and takes his leave. Eddard rushes to their aid and delivers a serious blow to Tregar, but he falls from his horse and breaks his leg. Jory, Heward, and Wyl are killed. The City Watch arrives some time later and brings him back to the Red Keep, where Grand Maester Pycelle prepares to treat his wounds.","Daenerys enters Vaes Dothrak with Drogo, his bloodriders1, Ser Jorah, Viserys, Aggo, Rakharo and her other khas at the head of the khalasar. Viserys, now universally mocked by the Dothraki after being forced to walk and ride in a cart, is getting very impatient to march on Westeros. Jorah tells Daenerys that Viserys should have remained in Pentos and that Dothraki see the world differently. Viserys sees Daenerys as the price for Drogo's support, but Drogo sees her as a gift for which he will give a return gift in his own good time. Daenerys points out that Viserys will leave when he has his ten thousand, but Jorah retorts that Viserys is incompetent and could not prevail no matter the size of his army. Daenerys asks how the Dothraki would fare under a competent commander, and Jorah considers. Drogo has forty thousand warriors, as many as Rhaegar had at the Trident, however only a tenth of these were knights. Dothraki fighting from horseback with hit and run attacks would probably be able to defeat a western army in the field, but the Dothraki care little for siegecraft and would never be able to take a castle. As Irri and Jhiqui help Daenerys off her silver, Cohollo comes over and says that Drogo will ascend the Mother to offer a sacrifice. Daenerys has Doreah invite Viserys to dinner so that she can present him with gifts, fine Dothraki clothing. Viserys arrives and scorns her gifts and threatens her, so she hits him, and he leaves. She curls up with one of her dragon eggs and goes to sleep, confident that the child in her womb will one day be a king.","Bran takes his first ride out of Winterfell on his new horse, Dancer. With him are Robb, Theon, Summer, Grey Wind, Joseth, Maester Luwin, and four guards, including Quent and Wayn. On the way out of town, Theon calls out to Bessa and Kyra, two women he has lain with on more than one occasion. As they ride on into the wolfswood, Robb tells Bran about the death of Jory and Eddard's injury. Theon thinks Robb should call the banners, but Robb is undecided as of yet. He has, however, fortified Moat Cailin after receiving a letter from Catelyn. Bran loses his enjoyment of the ride and wants to go back, but they need to find the direwolves first.
Robb and Bran slowly outdistance their guard. They hear the direwolves in the distance, and Robb goes off to bring them in. Soon after, Bran is set upon by four men, including Stiv and Wallen who deserted from the Night's Watch, and two women, Hali and Osha. Bran identifies himself and threatens them. Hali wants to kill him, but Osha says he would be worth more to Mance alive. Stiv says he is not going back to face the white walkers.1 As Stiv prepares to cut Bran off Dancer, Robb returns with Summer and Grey Wind. They charge, and soon everyone is dead except Osha and Stiv, who takes Bran hostage. Suddenly, Stiv is felled by an arrow from Theon as the guard arrives. Robb is furious at Theon for such a reckless act, and is even more enraged to learn that the guard did not get there sooner because Theon went off hunting turkey. They take Osha back to Winterfell for questioning.","Tyrion is in a cell being taunted and tormented by his gaoler, Mord. One end of his cell is open to the sky, and Mord says that he will jump to his death eventually. Tyrion thinks back to how he got into this predicament. It began during his audience with Lord Robert and Lady Lysa. Lysa accused him of murdering Jon, causing him to become very annoyed and very sarcastic. Robert almost had him killed before Catelyn reminded Lysa that Tyrion is her prisoner and not to be harmed. Ser Vardis took him to a cell instead, where he is routinely mistreated by Mord. He wonders whether Jaime and Cersei really did conspire to kill Jon,1 and wonders why the attack on Bran was so clumsy, finding that odd.2 He thinks that someone may be trying to start a feud between Stark and Lannister.3 He decides that he will die if confined in the cell much longer and decides he must get out. He calls for Mord and promises him gold in exchange for aid. Mord is reluctant at first and starts beating him, but finally consents to take Tyrion's message to Lysa that Tyrion is ready to confess his crimes.
That night, Ser Vardis comes for Tyrion and brings him before the Lady Lysa. All the powerful houses of the Vale are represented in the High Hall. The attendees include Ser Brynden, Lord Nestor, Ser Albar Royce, Ser Lyn Corbray, Lord Eon Hunter, Lady Anya Waynwood and her sons.4 Others present bear sigils he does not recognize such as a broken lance,5 a green viper,6 a burning tower,7 and a winged chalice.8 Ser Rodrik, Ser Willis, Marillion, and Bronn are also there. As Tyrion enters, Bronn looks pointedly at him with hand on pommel. Tyrion steps forward and begins confessing his crimes, that he lays with whores, gambles, mocks, etc. Catelyn accuses him again of plotting to kill Bran, and he denies it. Lysa is about to send him back to his cell, but he demands a trial. Lysa says Lord Robert will hear his case, but Tyrion demands trial by combat. Lysa appoints Ser Vardis as her champion and Tyrion names Jaime, but Lysa will only allow him to choose someone who is present. Bronn stands up and volunteers.","Eddard dreams an old dream of the day he was reunited with Lyanna. He rides with six friends, Martyn Cassel, Theo Wull, Brandon's squire Ethan Glover, Ser Mark Ryswell, Howland Reed, and Lord William Dustin. Before them is the Tower of Joy, hard against the Red Mountains, and three knights of the Kingsguard, Ser Arthur Dayne, Ser Oswell Whent, and the Lord Commander, Ser Gerold Hightower. Eddard tells them he looked for them on the Trident, at King's Landing, and at Storm's End and thought perhaps they were with Ser Willem Darry on Dragonstone, but they say that they swore a vow and do not run. Just as he and his companions close to fight the Kingsguard, Eddard wakes up.
Vayon tells Eddard he has been unconscious for six days and seven nights and that Robert commanded to be called the moment he woke up. Eddard sends Vayon to fetch the king. Alyn, now captain of the guard with Jory dead, enters and tells him that Jaime has fled the city to join Lord Tywin at Casterly Rock. Jory's body has been sent north to lay with his grandfather. His father, Martyn, is buried at the former site of the Tower of Joy with Ser Mark, Theo, Ethan, and Lord William; only Eddard and Howland survived the encounter with the Kingsguard, and Eddard pulled the tower down afterward to make funeral cairns for his companions and the three Kingsguard. Vayon comes back to tell him that Robert and Cersei have arrived.
Eddard takes responsibility for Catelyn's seizure of Tyrion, saying it was done at his command. Robert is unhappy that eight men are dead, Eddard's three companions, four Lannister guards at the scene, and Tregar, who died that very morning of the blow Eddard gave him. Cersei accuses Eddard of starting the fight after coming back from a brothel drunk, but Eddard counters that he was there to visit Barra, which does not please Robert or Cersei.1 Eddard asks permission to bring Jaime to justice for killing three of his men. Cersei says that the seizure was unlawful and that it is Eddard who should be brought to justice. Robert wants none of it and orders Tyrion's release and for Eddard to make peace with Jaime. Neither Eddard nor Cersei is happy. Cersei insults Robert, and he hits her, then has Ser Meryn escort her back to her chambers. When she is gone, he laments that he should not have hit her and wonders how he can fight an enemy he cannot hit. He thinks Rhaegar won after all; he has Lyanna while Robert is stuck with Cersei. He tells Eddard that he is going hunting and that, like it or not, Eddard will remain his Hand.","Catelyn looks out on Alyssa's Tears. They are named for Alyssa Arryn, who according to legend had seen her entire family die before her six thousand years ago, but refused to shed a tear. The story goes that she would not be allowed any rest until her tears watered the Vale of Arryn. Ser Rodrik reports on recent events to Catelyn. Jaime is gathering a host at Casterly Rock. Edmure Tully has demanded to know his intent and ordered Lord Vance and Lord Clement Piper to guard the pass below the Golden Tooth against him. Lord Hoster Tully was not mentioned in the letter at all, and must be very sick if he has given charge of the defense of the riverlands to Edmure. Catelyn decides she must return to Winterfell and tells Ser Rodrik that they will take ship from Gulltown after Tyrion's trial. She is most annoyed with Lysa, who is very moody and inconstant and has been played for a fool by Tyrion.
Ser Brynden joins Catelyn. He had asked leave of Lysa to take one thousand men and march to the riverlands. When she refused him, he resigned as Knight of the Gate and is now preparing to leave for Riverrun. Catelyn convinces him to join them on the ship back to Winterfell. Catelyn arrives at the site of the combat, where Lysa and Lord Robert are surrounded by knights and retainers, including Lord Eon and Ser Lyn, her two favored suitors at the moment, and Ser Morton. Catelyn tells Ser Rodrik that Robert is unfit to rule and must be taken away from Lysa. Maester Colemon comes up to her and says that Lord Jon agreed and was going to foster him at Dragonstone with Lord Stannis. Catelyn says he is mistaken and that Robert was going to Casterly Rock and that the arrangements were made after Jon's death.1 2 Maester Colemon begins to rebut, but at that point Tyrion is brought in, with Bronn and Ser Vardis appearing soon after. Vardis is fully armored; Bronn wears only mail and a halfhelm.
A septon blesses the trial, and the fight begins. Watching the battle takes Catelyn back to the combat years ago when Petyr fought Brandon Stark for her hand. Petyr begged her for a favor to wear, but she had to refuse. She gave one to Brandon instead, and begged him not to kill Petyr. Brandon gave him a dozen wounds and drove him all over the yard demanding that he yield, but was finally required to give a potentially mortal blow when Petyr steadfastly refused. Petyr said Catelyn's name as he fell, and it was the last time Catelyn saw him until their meeting in King's Landing. It took Petyr two weeks to recover enough from his wounds to travel. Catelyn was forbidden to see him during that time, but Lysa was a constant companion. Edmure tried to visit too, but Petyr refused to see him because he acted as Brandon's squire in the duel. Lord Hoster sent him back to the Fingers to finish his healing at home.
The sounds of combat bring Catelyn back to the battle at hand. Bronn dodges around Ser Vardis, darting this way and that to tire his heavily armored foe. When Vardis is near exhaustion, Bronn closes in and begins pressing him fiercely. Vardis makes one final bull rush to try and end it, but Bronn darts aside, topples a statue on top of him, and delivers the killing blow. Lysa realizes she must free Tyrion, but orders him and Bronn put out on the high road, where she believes they will die.","Ser Alliser has learned that Gueren is bringing five new recruits to Castle Black, so he decides to elevate Halder, Todder, Albett, Pypar, Grenn, Matthar, Dareon, and Jon to full members of the Night's Watch. Sam congratulates them, but seems depressed. That night, Bowen Marsh personally leads them to a seat by the fire and Three-Finger Hobb cooks them a special meal. Jon is worried when he does not see Sam at dinner and realizes that Sam is afraid because with Jon gone he will probably get hurt again by less savory trainees such as Rast and Cuger. He rides with Ghost for awhile thinking. He considers not joining the Watch, but quickly discounts that. He thinks of Sam again and goes to see Maester Aemon. Chett answers the door and does not want to admit Jon at first, but he insists, and Chett gets the maester. Jon asks Maester Aemon to convince the Lord Commander to raise Sam to the Watch, saying he will be hurt or killed otherwise. He says that every man has a use and that Sam would be ideal for helping Maester Aemon with his work, particularly since Chett cannot read and his other assistant, an albino named Clydas, has weak eyes. The maester says he will think on it and sends Jon away.","Tyrion and Bronn stop to take shelter along the high road. They have been riding all day since being put out of the Vale by Ser Lyn. Tyrion gathers wood to start a fire. Bronn threatens to leave, but Tyrion offers him any reward if he stays to protect Tyrion, and he accepts. Tyrion lights a fire to draw some mountain clansmen in. He mentions his mistreatment in the dungeon of the Eyrie, and Bronn registers surprise that Tyrion gave Mord the gold he promised the gaoler. Tyrion merely replies that a Lannister always pays his debts. Bronn asks where they will go now, and Tyrion says he means to make inquiries about a certain dagger. With no clansmen coming yet, Tyrion begins to whistle a Myrish song called ""The Seasons of My Love."" He tells Bronn that the first woman he ever bedded used to sing that song, and it has been stuck in his head ever since. He goes on to tell the story of their meeting.
When he was thirteen, Tyrion was riding back to Casterly Rock from Lannisport with Jaime when they encountered a girl named Tysha being chased by bandits. After they saved the girl, Jaime rode off to get help to hunt down the bandits while Tyrion took the girl to a nearby inn. She was a crofter's daughter orphaned when her father died of fever, but Tyrion drank too much wine and they had sex. Tyrion fell in love and married her in front of a drunken septon. For two weeks they played at being husband and wife at a cottage until the septon sobered up and told Lord Tywin. The furious lord first made Jaime tell the truth that Tysha was a whore he hired because he felt it was time Tyrion had his first woman.1 Then he gave Tysha to his guards, making them each pay a silver piece to take her. When they were done, Tywin made Tyrion go last, but for a gold piece because a Lannister is worth more. Bronn says he would kill any man that did that to him, and Tyrion says he may get that chance, for a Lannister always pays his debts.
Sometime later, they are accosted by about ten Stone Crows including their chief, Gunthor, Shagga, Conn, Torrek, and Jaggot. They are about to kill Tyrion, but he promises to deliver them suitable weapons and armor from his father so they can take the Vale.","Eddard sits on the Iron Throne with part of the small council, Varys, Petyr, and Pycelle. Ser Arys stands guard at the foot of the throne, as do Alyn and Porther. Sansa is in the gallery watching with Septa Mordane. Robert is still out hunting and has been joined by Lord Renly, Ser Barristan, Prince Joffrey, Sandor, Ser Balon, Lord Yohn, and half the court. Eddard is listening to testimony from Ser Raymun Darry, Ser Karyl Vance, and Ser Marq Piper about Lannister raids that have destroyed the holdfasts of Sherrer, Mummer's Ford, and Wendish Town. A brewer from Sherrer named Joss testifies that Gregor Clegane was the leader of the raiders. No one had been present to defend the holdfasts because all the banners had been called. Edmure has since sent men to guard all the holdfasts, and Eddard realizes that this was probably Tywin's plan all along to bleed off strength.1 Edmure wanted to take vengeance right away, but Lord Hoster made him send to the king first for permission.
Pycelle tries to divert the issue, first suggesting that the knights take up the matter with Gregor's liege lord, Tywin, and then suggesting they wait for the king to return, but Eddard decides he must act. He sends Ser Robar to tell Robert what has happened and attaints Ser Gregor for treason, has him stripped of all titles, and sentences him to death. He says he would normally lead the party to bring Gregor to justice, but his leg prevents him. Ser Loras asks for the honor of leading the party in his stead, but Eddard gives leadership to Lord Beric instead. Lord Beric, Thoros of Myr, Ser Gladden Wylde, and Lord Lothar Mallery are each to take twenty men along with twenty of Eddard's personal guard to see justice done. Varys comes up to Eddard afterward and says he should have sent Loras to secure friendship with the Tyrells against the Lannisters and that he should also have sent Ser Ilyn since he is the king's executioner. Varys says Ser Ilyn was in the back and did not look happy.","Sansa is talking to Jeyne over dinner. She is shocked that Eddard did not send Loras after Gregor because it would be just like in the songs and stories. She had been saying as much to Septa Mordane at court earlier, and Petyr came up to her and told her that life was not a song and that she may find this out to her regret. Yoren had also been at court, and Eddard gave him leave to choose men from the dungeons for the Night's Watch. The next morning, she wakes up early to watch Lord Beric's party ride off, with Alyn carrying the Stark banner.1 Afterward, she joins Arya and Septa Mordane for breakfast. Sansa explains to Arya what is happening with Gregor, and Arya says she wishes someone would kill Jaime and Sandor for their murders. Sansa repeats her lie that Mycah attacked Joffrey, and Arya throws an orange at her. They exchange insults, and Septa Mordane sends them to their rooms. Eddard summons them both to him later. He informs them that he is sending them back to Winterfell for their own safety. Sansa begs to stay and says she loves Joffrey as Queen Naerys loved Prince Aemon and Jonquil Ser Florian and wants to marry him. During the course of the conversation, Sansa says that Joffrey is nothing like the king, and Eddard suddenly gets a strange look on his face.2 He sends the girls back to their rooms.","Pycelle is tending to Eddard's leg. He tells Eddard that Lord Tywin has sent a letter to Cersei expressing discontent over the Gregor situation. Eddard says that if Tywin interferes, he will have Robert to answer to, and Pycelle hurries off, probably to report to Cersei. Eddard now realizes thanks to Sansa that Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen are not Robert's children, and he believes this is the secret Jon died for.1 Lord Petyr stops by and reports that sellswords and freeriders are gathering at Casterly Rock. Robert continues to hunt, but some of the party, including Joffrey, Sandor, Ser Balon, Lord Yohn, and Ser Robar have returned. Petyr says that Sandor is probably not happy at the moment because he does not want anyone but himself killing his brother. After Petyr leaves, Eddard returns to his musings. He trusts Petyr only a little and Varys not at all. He feels that Pycelle is certainly a Lannister creature and that Ser Barristan is too old and rigid to help. He knows he must speak to Robert upon his return. Vayon has arranged for Eddard's daughters to leave on the Wind Witch out of Braavos, captained by a man named Qos, in three days. Eddard remembers how Lord Tywin presented the bodies of Rhaegar's children to Robert and wants to make sure that Cersei's children do not suffer a similar fate. Eddard summons Tomard, who now commands the guard with Alyn off hunting Gregor, and has him and Varly take him to the godswood and has Tomard deliver a message to Cersei.
Cersei arrives at sunset, and Eddard accuses her and Jaime of being lovers, which she admits. He brings up Bran's accident, and she confirms that Jaime pushed him. He asks if all three of her children are Jaime's, and she says yes. Eddard figured this must be the case. Jon Arryn's last words that the ""seed is strong"" apparently referred to the dominance of dark hair color in Baratheon children. All of Robert's bastards have dark hair, yet Cersei's children are all blond. The book of lineages by Grand Maester Malleon records the last marriage between a Lannister and a Baratheon ninety years before in which Gowen Baratheon, third son of the lord at the time, wed Tya Lannister who gave birth to a boy who died in infancy that had black hair. Thirty years before that, a male Lannister wed a Baratheon who bore three daughters and a son that all had black hair. Eddard could find no Lannister-Baratheon marriage in the book resulting in a blonde-haired child. Eddard asks Cersei how she avoided getting with child from Robert, and she explains that she did once but had an abortion. After that, she found other ways to please Robert, and he was usually too drunk to care anyway. She says she has hated him since their wedding night when he called her Lyanna in his passion. Cersei tries to seduce Eddard, but fails. Eddard says he will tell Robert the truth when he returns and that Cersei and her children should have fled Westeros by then or face full punishment. Cersei tells him that he should have taken the throne fifteen years ago and that he should fear her wrath.","With Drogo and the dosh khaleen looking on, Daenerys eats a stallion's heart. Other spectators include Daenerys's handmaidens, Irri, Jhiqui, and Doreah; Drogo's bloodriders, Cohollo, Haggo, and Qotho; Khal Ogo and his son Fogo; and Khal Jommo with his four wives. The Dothraki believe that if she eats the whole heart her baby will be strong; if she fails, her child will be female, deformed, or even stillborn. When Daenerys is finished, the crones declare that her son will be the ""stallion who mounts the world."" They ask for a name, and she names him Rhaego. She then proceeds to the Womb of the World and cleanses herself. Afterwards, she rides her silver to Drogo's tent for a feast.
Daenerys does not see Viserys in the feast tent and calls Jorah over to ask where he is. Jorah informs her that he went looking for wine. He has been talking to caravan guards in the hopes of hiring them, and talks of using Daenerys's dragon eggs as payment. She asks who the stallion that mounts the world is, and Jorah explains that he is the khal of khals who will unite the Dothraki and conquer the world. Suddenly, Viserys arrives drunk with a sword on his hip. He demands to see Daenerys and to have a place at the feast. Drogo points to the farthest corner where those with no honor sit, and Viserys is affronted. He is mocked and draws his sword despite Jorah's protests. He goes to Daenerys and threatens her baby unless Drogo gives him his promised crown. Drogo melts his gold medallions as his bloodriders seize Viserys and then pours the molten gold over Viserys.","Eddard is woken from sleep by Tomard and Cayn, who have brought the King's steward with a summons to see Robert, who has returned from his hunt. Eddard passes Ser Boros, Ser Preston, and Ser Barristan on his way to the king's chambers and knows something is wrong when he sees Barristan's face. When he enters the king's chambers, he sees Pycelle, Renly, and Cersei all hovering around Robert, who is mortally wounded. He had drunk too much wine and missed a thrust against a boar, which tore him from groin to nipple. Robert orders everyone to leave so he can speak to Eddard alone. He repents for sending assassins after Daenerys and tells Eddard to get paper and ink. He dictates his will, naming Eddard Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm until Joffrey comes of age. Eddard starts to tell him the truth about Joffrey, but cannot bring himself to hurt Robert more. Instead, he just writes ""my heir"" in the will instead of ""Joffrey."" Robert also tells Eddard to let Daenerys live. They call Renly and Pycelle back in to witness the sealing of the will and then Pycelle gives Robert milk of the poppy so he will sleep.
As Eddard exits the king's chamber, Varys comes up to him and Ser Barristan and asks how Robert came to be so drunk. Barristan replies that the king's squire, Lancel, provided him with a steady supply of wine,1 and Eddard realizes that the Lannisters killed the king. Eddard orders Varys to cancel any arrangements he made to kill Daenerys. As he walks back to his own quarters, Renly approaches him and offers to give him one hundred swords to seize Joffrey, Tommen, and Myrcella so that the small council will confirm Eddard as Lord Protector and ward of Joffrey. Eddard refuses the offer and Renly stalks away.
When Eddard returns to his quarters, he tells Cayn to find Petyr, then tells Tomard to personally escort his daughters to the Wind Witch the next evening with twenty men and to stop by Dragonstone on the way back to Winterfell to deliver a letter to Stannis. Afterwards, he writes the letter to Stannis, which urges him to sail to King's Landing with all his strength to claim the throne. As he finishes the letter, Cayn and Desmond arrive with Lord Petyr. Eddard tells him about Cersei and the children, which does not seem to surprise him, and Petyr advises Eddard not to deal with Stannis, claiming that it will mean war as the Lannisters will fight and the Tyrells, Greyjoys and others whom Robert pardoned will also rise for fear of punishment from the far more taciturn Stannis. Petyr offers to aid Eddard in ruling as regent for a modest price, but Eddard refuses and says it must be Stannis. He wants Petyr to insure the loyalty of the City Watch, and Petyr says he will pay them six thousand gold pieces so they will join Eddard in overcoming Cersei's soldiers when the time comes.","Sam comes up to Jon and says he is to be raised to the Night's Watch with the others. He will assist Maester Aemon with the ravens and the library as Jon had suggested. They join Todder, Pypar, Albett, Halder, Matthar, Grenn, and Dareon in the sept, where Septon Cellador is preparing for the ceremony. Soon Maester Aemon, leaning on Clydas, Jeor Mormont, Alliser Thorne, Bowen Marsh, Othell Yarwyck, and Jaremy Rykker, who is acting first ranger with Benjen missing, arrive. Jeor explains the ceremony and the oath and asks if there are any who keep to the old gods. Jon speaks up, and Sam decides to swear to them as well. Jeor explains that Castle Black has no godswood, but that there is a grove on the edge of the haunted forest where they may swear. Next, he gives out assignments. Halder and Albett join the builders, Grenn, Pypar, Matthar, and Todder the rangers, and Sam, Dareon, and Jon the stewards. Jon is shocked and hurt and figures this was retribution by Ser Alliser. Bowen assigns Sam to Maester Aemon, replacing Chett who will go to the kennels, and sends Dareon to Eastwatch to aid Borcas, the head steward there, in dealing with traders. Jon is to be Lord Commander Mormont's personal steward; the lord commander selected him personally. Jon is furious, but Sam points out that he is probably being groomed for command. Late in the afternoon, Sam and Jon set out with Bowen Marsh and an escort, including Dywen, to the edge of the forest. Ghost comes too. They kneel before a grove of nine weirwood trees and take their vows. Afterwards, Ghost comes up to Jon with a rotted human hand in his jaws.","Eddard awakes to the sound of Lannister guardsmen drilling with Sandor in the yard below. He takes breakfast with Septa Mordane, Arya, and Sansa. Arya asks to have one more lesson with Syrio before leaving, and Eddard gives his assent. Pycelle comes in after breakfast to report that Robert is dead, and Eddard has him convene the small council in Eddard's solar. Ser Barristan arrives first, followed by Petyr, who says all arrangements are made, and then Varys. Varys reports that Renly and Loras left for the south early in the morning. Eddard has Ser Barristan read Robert's will and asks to be confirmed in his role as lord protector. Just then, Tomard arrives with the king's steward, who asks that the small council attend Joffrey.
Eddard, the council, Tomard, and eight members of Eddard's guard walk to the throne room. Janos Slynt meets the council at the door and escorts them in. Joffrey sits on the throne with Tommen, Myrcella, and Cersei at the base. Ser Mandon, Ser Meryn, Ser Arys, Ser Boros and Ser Preston are arrayed at the base of the throne in full armor. Sandor also guards the prince. Twenty Lannister guardsmen stand behind the throne and city watchmen are arrayed along both walls. Joffrey asks for the fealty of the council, and Eddard produces the king's letter. Cersei rips it in half and tells Eddard that if he swears fealty he will be allowed to go back to the North and live in peace. Instead, Eddard denies Joffrey's claim to the throne and declares Stannis to be the true heir. Cersei orders Ser Barristan to seize him, and Eddard orders the City Watch to take Cersei into custody. Instead, they turn on Eddard's men, killing all of them, including Tomard, Varly and Cayn. Petyr unsheathes Eddard's dagger and places it at his throat.","Syrio gives Arya a lesson. He calls out where he will strike so that Arya can counter, but he lies on the final thrust and gets through her defense. Arya is upset, but Syrio points out that his whole body showed the point of attack and only his words were lies. He then tells her a story about the importance of seeing what is really there rather than what someone says is there. When Syrio's predecessor as first sword died, the Sealord of Braavos began conducting interviews with bravos from the city one at a time. When Syrio was brought before him, the Sealord had a beast on his lap he said was brought from a faraway land. Syrio recognized it as an immensely fat yet otherwise ordinary cat and was given the job. All the other candidates had seen an exotic beast because the Sealord said it was exotic, but Syrio saw through the lie. The lesson learned, Syrio tells Arya he is pleased with her progress and believes he might let her use Needle when they get to Winterfell. Suddenly, Ser Meryn bursts into the room with five Lannister guards. He says that Arya's father wants to see her, but Syrio sees through the ruse, and Ser Meryn orders Arya taken. Syrio intercedes to give her time to escape, and Ser Meryn orders him killed. Syrio takes on and defeats all five guards, killing some of them, but cannot do much against the fully armored Ser Meryn. He tells Arya to run and closes with his foe and almost certain death.
Arya runs into an underground storeroom and then crawls out a window. She sees the Tower of the Hand, with the doors bashed in and one of her father's guards dead at the door. She hears the sounds of fighting from within. She realizes she cannot go that way and heads to the stables instead. She sees Hullen at the entrance; he has been stabbed many times. Hullen tells her to warn her father and dies. Inside, there are more dead men: a groom, three Stark guards, including Desmond, and one dead Lannister guard. She sees her chest and searches through it for Needle. A stableboy sees her and tries to turn her in, but she stabs and kills him. She realizes the gates will be shut, but remembers the passage where she had seen the strange men.1 It takes her a while, but she finds her way down and walks towards freedom.","Sansa has been held in her room for three days. On the first day, she had gone to the queen and told her of Eddard's plan to send her away so that she might get her or the king to stop it. Cersei then had her escorted back to a secure room in Maegor's Holdfast, where she heard the fighting begin. Jeyne was placed in the room with her and told her everybody was being killed. On the second day, they heard all the bells in the city ringing to announce the death of King Robert. On the third day, Ser Boros comes to escort her to Cersei. They walk out of Maegor's Holdfast to the council chambers, where Ser Mandon admits them to see the queen, who is with Petyr, Pycelle, and Varys. Sansa asks after Jeyne's father, Vayon, and Pycelle looks embarrassed, which seems to indicate he was killed. Cersei is annoyed that Jeyne was placed with Sansa, and Petyr says that he will find a place for her. Cersei tells Sansa that Eddard was a traitor who tried to steal the throne and manipulates her through her ""love"" for Joffrey into writing a letter telling her brother not to take up arms.","Lord Commander Mormont and Ser Jaremy have arrived to examine the corpses Ghost discovered. Jon is there as well, and so are Chett, Sam, who represents Maester Aemon, and a dozen rangers including Dywen, Hake and Ketter. Earlier, Bass, the kennelmaster, tried to get the dogs to take a scent from the hand Ghost brought back, but they refused to do so. Chett is handling the dogs now, and they are fighting him and refusing to go near the corpses. Ser Jaremy recognizes the dead men as Othor and Jafer Flowers, both of whom were part of Ben Stark's ranging. Ser Jaremy thinks they must have been dead only a day, but Sam points out that the blood has dried up and they must have been dead longer. It is strange though, because there is no sign of rotting, or maggots, and no animals other than Ghost will get close. Both corpses also have bright blue eyes, though neither one's eyes were ever blue. Lord Commander Mormont orders the corpses returned to Castle Black so Maester Aemon can examine them and orders Ser Jaremy to scour the surrounding woods.
Bowen meets the group as they return to the Wall and tells Lord Commander Mormont that a raven has come. As Jon returns to his quarters, everyone from Ser Alliser to Donal Noye stares at him. He finds Pyp, Grenn, and Todder and learns that Robert is dead. He returns to Lord Commander Mormont's quarters, and the lord commander tells him about Eddard being arrested and charged with treason. He is in a daze for the rest of the day. Everyone knows what happened. He gets piteous looks, and Hobb gives him an extra helping at dinner. Matthar, Pyp, Grenn, Todder and Sam try to comfort him. He hears Ser Alliser slandering Eddard and attacks, leading to his being subdued and imprisoned.
After some time, Jon dozes off in his cell, and when he wakes up, it has gotten very cold and Ghost is scrabbling at the door. He opens the door and sees his guard dead with his head twisted around. He goes up to the Lord Commander's chambers and sees a dark shape going in. When he follows, he discovers it is the supposedly dead Othor.1 He hacks Othor's arm off as well as half of his face, but Othor keeps coming and so does the severed arm. Othor starts to strangle Jon, but Ghost saves him. Lord Commander Mormont stumbles out with an oil lamp, and Jon grabs it, torches the drapes, and throws the burning mass at Othor.","Robb has called the banners. The Karstarks are the last to arrive with 300 horse and 2,000 foot from Karhold. Bran watches them arrive on Hodor's shoulders with Maester Luwin. Hodor is carrying him around in a basket that the maester devised. Bran has been confined to the castle for his safety since the incident in the woods. Lord Rickard Karstark rides at the head of his men accompanied by his sons, Harrion, Torrhen, and Eddard. Other houses that have arrived in recent days include Glover, Mormont, Bolton, Hornwood, Cerwyn, Tallhart, and Umber. Robb hosts them each in turn. Maester Luwin tells Bran that the Karstarks bring the total to 12,000 men, of which 3,000 are horse. The houses Manderly and Flint will join Robb on the way south to the Riverlands. The castle and town are full to bursting, and Robb must march soon.
Bran decides to go to the godswood. Hodor carries him in the wicker basket on his shoulders. Some Karstark men stare at him, so he calls Summer to unnerve them. As he passes the forge, Bran sees Mikken hard at work. When he arrives, he gives a prayer for Robb, Catelyn, Arya, Sansa, Eddard, and Rickon and thinks back over the events of the last few days. Rickon has been wild since learning that Robb is leaving. He ran to the crypts with Shaggydog and slashed at the people who came after him with a sword. Shaggydog has been wild too, and they were forced to chain him up. Robb has grown greatly recently. His bannermen tried to test him. Roose Bolton, Robett Glover, and Maege Mormont all disputed his authority, while Medger Cerwyn and Halys Hornwood both tried to flatter him with gifts. Greatjon Umber was the worst, threatening to leave and then insulting Robb and unsheathing his sword until Grey Wind tackled him and bit off two fingers. After this incident, the Greatjon became Robb's staunchest supporter. Sansa's note arrived, and Robb was incredulous and wonders what is wrong with her. Bran says she lost her wolf, thinking back to when Lady's bones arrived at Winterfell.
As Bran finishes his prayers, the leaves rustle in the wind, and Osha comes in and says this means the old gods are listening, but are sad because they cannot watch over those in the south due to a lack of weirwoods. She has been working as a kitchen servant and comes to the godswood to pray from time to time. She also says that the gods have no power in the south because the weirwoods are gone. She has been trying to warn Robb that the Others are coming, but is being ignored. That is the reason she fled south, unlike Mance Rayder, who was resolved to stand and fight, which she considers a stubborn and stupid move by a Night's Watch deserter from the Shadow Tower. That evening, Bran hosts the Karstarks, and Rickard's sons mock his handicap. Two days later, Robb marches south with Hallis Mollen, Theon Greyjoy and his lords bannermen.","Drogo tells Daenerys that he has no intention now to invade the Seven Kingdoms and goes off to hunt. Daenerys summons Ser Jorah as Irri, Jhiqui and Doreah attend her and tells him that he must help convince Drogo to march. He promises that they will go home, but they must be patient. To cheer her up, he tells her that a caravan led by a merchant captain named Byan Votyris has arrived, and Daenerys decides to go see it. She is accompanied by Irri, Jhqui, Doreah, Aggo, Jhogo, Rakharo, Quaro and Ser Jorah. They wander about for a while, and then Jorah goes off to see if Illyrio has sent any messages.
Eventually, Daenerys comes across a wineseller hawking his wares. When he learns Daenerys's identity, he offers her a special cask of wine from the Arbor. Just then, Jorah returns and orders the merchant to open the cask and drink from it. The wine is poisoned, and the seller bolts instead, but is caught. Byan arrives and orders the man seized for the khal and gives the man's stock to Daenerys. They return to her quarters, and Jorah explains that a letter arrived from Illyrio warning that Robert had offered a lordship for her death and that of her son. She suddenly eyes her dragon eggs and gets a strange idea. She has Jorah light the brazier and take his leave. When he is gone, she thrusts the eggs into the fire, but nothing happens. When Drogo returns and learns about the assassination attempt, he vows to take the Seven Kingdoms for his unborn son.","Catelyn and Ser Brynden are with Ser Wendel and Ser Wylis Manderly and their 1,500 levies, which include twenty knights and two hundred mounted lances. Their father, Lord Wyman Manderly, has stayed behind in White Harbor to see to the defenses, largely because he has grown too fat to sit a horse. Robb's host is just coming into view. She rides through to Moat Cailin with Ser Wendel and Ser Brynden and finds Robb with Grey Wind surrounded by his lords bannermen, including Ser Helman Tallhart, Greatjon Umber, Robett and Galbart Glover, Roose Bolton, Halys Hornwood, Rickard Karstark and Theon Greyjoy. She informs him that Ser Rodrik is on his way north to serve as castellan of Winterfell while Robb is in the south. Catelyn sends the bannermen away to speak to Robb alone.
Catelyn fears for Robb's safety and wants to send him back to Winterfell, but knows she cannot without causing him to lose face. Robb informs her that a letter arrived from Sansa telling him not to fight. Catelyn realizes right away that Sansa is now a hostage. Robb has eighteen thousand men, but is afraid about what might happen to Eddard and Sansa. Catelyn assures him that victory in the field is now the only option. Robb tells Catelyn of what has transpired in the riverlands. Jaime marched up the Golden Tooth and smashed a force led by Lord Vance and Lord Clement Piper. Lord Vance was slain, and Lord Clement fell back to Riverrun. Meanwhile, Lord Tywin came up from the south with an even larger army, which ambushed Lord Beric's men from King's Landing. Ser Raymun Darry and most of the men from Winterfell were killed. Lord Beric may have escaped, but no one knows for sure.
Robb has ordered Howland Reed to bleed any Lannister host that comes north, but knows that Lord Tywin is too smart to try and will stay in the riverlands taking castles one by one to isolate Riverrun. Therefore, Robb has no choice but to ride south to meet him. Robb's plan is to split his horse and foot. The foot will march on Tywin and draw him in while the horse races to Riverrun to surprise Jaime. He plans to give the Greatjon the foot while he commands the horse, but Catelyn points out that the Greatjon is too brash and Robb decides to give Roose Bolton the command instead. Robb tells Catelyn he will prepare an escort to take her back to Winterfell, but Catelyn says that with her father dying and her brother surrounded, she must go to them.","Tyrion approaches a Lannister camp of 20,000 men with Bronn and 300 clansmen of the Stone Crows, Moon Brothers, Black Ears, and Burned Men. Gunthor stayed in the mountains to rally the other clans to Tyrion's cause. Tyrion decides to ride ahead with Shagga, Conn, Chella, Ulf, and Timett, representatives from each of the mountain clans with Tyrion. They reach a checkpoint and are escorted to the main camp of Lord Tywin's army. Ser Flement Brax greets them and takes them to Tywin. Lord Tywin has taken as his headquarters the very inn from which Tyrion was abducted, and Tyrion sees Masha's corpse hanging from a gibbet.
Tyrion enters the common room to find Lord Tywin sharing a pitcher of ale with his brother, Ser Kevan. Tywin greets Tyrion coldly and treats him with disdain throughout their conversation. Tyrion learns that Tywin has destroyed the small parties that Edmure sent to stop Gregor's raids while Jaime met Edmure before the walls of Riverrun and defeated and captured him. Lord Tytos Blackwood managed to extricate the remains of Edmure's force and get inside Riverrun, which is now under siege. Lord Tywin took Lord Tytos's seat of Raventree and Lady Shella Whent yielded Harrenhal for want of men to defend it. Gregor has burned out the Pipers and the Brackens. In addition to Riverrun, only the Mallisters in Seagard and Walder Frey at the Twins remain to resist the Lannisters. Marq Piper and Karyl Vance are loose in the Lannister rear, raiding. Tyrion learns of Robert's death and Eddard's imprisonment. Lord Beric and Thoros are also still alive and harassing the rear. Just then, the clansmen burst in on the meeting. Tyrion introduces them and begins to explain why they are there when a messenger arrives from Ser Addam Marbrand stating that Robb is moving south. Lord Tywin decides to meet him and finish him quickly so that he can deal with Stannis. He tells the clansmen that if they ride with him, all his son promised and more will be theirs.","Sansa arrives for the first court of King Joffrey's reign. She has been given free rein of the castle, but is always ""escorted."" The walls of the throne room have been stripped of Robert's hunting tapestries. Three Kingsguard; Ser Mandon, Ser Meryn and Ser Preston, stand at the foot of the throne and twenty or so lords wait for Joffrey to arrive, including Lord Gyles Rosby. Other attendees include Jalabhar Xho, Horas and Hobber Redwyne, Ser Aron Santagar, Ser Balon Swann and Ser Dontos Hollard. Grand Maester Pycelle, Varys, and Petyr assume their seats on the small council and then Joffrey enters with Cersei, Ser Barristan, Ser Boros and Ser Arys.
Joffrey has Grand Maester Pycelle read off a long list of those who must come to King's Landing to swear fealty to Joffrey or be named traitors. These include Stannis Baratheon and his wife and daughter;1 Renly Baratheon; Nestor Royce and his son Albar; Yohn Royce and his sons Andar and Robar; Lysa and Robert Arryn; Mace Tyrell and his brothers, uncles, and sons;2 Hoster, Brynden and Edmure Tully; Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr; Doran Martell; Bryce Caron; the great lords of the riverlands, Jonos Bracken, Karyl Vance, Tytos Blackwood, Shella Whent, Walder Frey and his heir Ser Stevron, and Jason Mallister; and Robb, Catelyn, Brandon, Arya and Rickon Stark. He names Lord Tywin the new Hand of the King and names Cersei to the small council as queen regent. Furthermore, he elevates Janos Slynt to Lord of Harrenhal and to the small council. Lord Janos comes in at that point with two of his sons3 and takes his seat on the council.
Next, the queen relieves Ser Barristan as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard and names Jaime to the post. Barristan is stunned, as the oath is for life. He talks of how he had always dreamed to be a Kingsguard and joined in his twenty-third year. Ser Gerold Hightower heard his vows, and he served alongside the likes of Prince Lewyn Martell and Arthur Dayne, protecting three kings, Robert, Aerys II, and Aerys's father Jaehaerys II. Cersei offers him land near Lannisport, but Barristan refuses, saying he will die a knight and walks out after insulting the other Kingsguard and Joffrey. Joffrey orders Barristan seized for questioning after he leaves, and Lord Janos says he will see it done. Cersei names Sandor Clegane to replace Ser Barristan on the Kingsguard. He accepts, but refuses to take a knight's vows, becoming the first member not to be a knight. When the pronouncements are over, Sansa comes forward and begs for mercy for Eddard. Joffrey and Cersei relent and say his life may be spared if he confesses his crimes.","Eddard lies in the dungeon for days, delirious with pain and infection. He thinks of events past and present and ponders the future and his own foolishness. Eventually, his mind wanders to the year of the false spring when he was eighteen and down from the Eyrie for the great tournament at Harrenhal. He remembers Brandon, Robert going wild in the melee, and Jaime Lannister kneeling in front of the king's pavilion and taking the vows of the Kingsguard with all six of his new brothers in attendance.1 Prince Rhaegar Targaryen owned the field that day, unhorsing all comers, including Brandon, Yohn Royce, and Arthur Dayne. Eddard remembers the moment when all the smiles died as Rhaegar rode past his own wife, Elia, to name Lyanna queen of love and beauty and give her a crown of winter roses. Thoughts of Lyanna once again make Eddard consider the promise he made her as she lay dying.
After many days, Varys comes down to see him disguised as a gaoler. He informs Eddard that Cersei will come down to see him the next day and ask him to confess his crimes and order his son to lay down his arms. If Eddard does so, he will be permitted to join the Night's Watch rather than be executed. Eddard at first refuses, but Varys lets him know that Sansa may pay the price in that case. Eddard realizes he has no choice.","Robb's host moves south. He is heading for the Twins, where Lord Walder Frey has amassed a force of 4,000 men. Every day, Robb meets with a different lord and listens to his input. Catelyn discusses Lord Walder with Robb as he meets with Robett and tells him that she fears he will be unfaithful to his oaths. Ser Brynden is commanding the outriders. Theon rides up to report that Brynden has crossed swords with Ser Addam's outriders and killed a dozen. He promises the Lannisters will not know when the army splits. He has surrounded the Twins with bowmen to bring down any ravens. Lord Walder has killed some Lannister scouts that wandered onto his land, but he is holding back his main strength. There is no other place to cross north of Lord Tywin but the Twins, and Robb must have the crossing. The next day, Ser Brynden personally reports on the battle at Riverrun.1 Robb is angry at Lord Walder and does not know what to do; Catelyn tells him he must negotiate.
Robb arrives at the Twins with his army flanked by Galbart, the Greatjon, Lord Rickard, Lord Roose, Ser Helman, Ser Wendel, and Ser Wylis. The gates are barred. Robb's bannermen concur that neither assault nor siege will break the fortress. Four of Walder's sons led by Ser Stevron come out to greet them. Ser Stevron reports that Lord Walder wants to speak with Robb inside. The northern lords are outraged and make their displeasure known. Catelyn seizes the moment and says she will go. Ser Perwyn Frey remains behind as a hostage while Stevron and the others take Catelyn inside. She is greeted by Lord Walder, surrounded by his entire family (minus Ser Perwyn of course), bastards and all.2 Two of his sons, Danwell and Whalen help him to his chair and his new wife of sixteen, Joyeuse, stands by his side.
Lord Walder is rude to Catelyn, much to the chagrin of both Ser Stevron and Walder's bastard son Ryger, and insults her father and brother too, but she endures his insults. Walder is bitter with Lord Tywin for not asking for his help, Lord Hoster for not coming to his last two weddings and not having Edmure marry one of his daughters, and Jon Arryn for not taking any of his grandsons to foster and sending Robert to foster with Stannis instead of him. Catelyn is surprised by this, as she thought he was going to be fostered with Lord Tywin, but Walder assures her it was Stannis.3 4 5 They finally get down to business and work out an agreement, which Catelyn brings back to Robb, escorted by Ser Jared, Ser Hosteen, Ser Danwell, and Ronel Rivers. By the terms, Robb may cross and Walder's men will join him, less four hundred that will stay to hold the Twins. In return, Catelyn will foster two of his grandsons, Walder and Walder, Robb will take Olyvar Frey as his squire, Elmar Frey is to wed Arya if she is alive, and Robb is to marry one of Walder's daughters after the fighting. Robb decides to leave Ser Helman at the Twins with four hundred men to insure Walder's loyalty. That evening, Robb crosses with the majority of his horse while Lord Roose stays on the other bank and marches south to confront Tywin.","Lord Commander Mormont checks on Jon, whose hand was seriously burned in the fire from killing the wight, and learns it will scar, but should heal well. Another ranging has returned, performed by Dywen and Hake, and once again found no sign of Benjen. A message arrived the night before stating that Ser Barristan had been removed from the Kingsguard and charged with treason. He slew two gold cloaks that came for him and left King's Landing. A message arrived before that telling of Robb's march to war, but Mormont did not tell Jon about that; Sam did. Jon is having a hard time dealing with that news and feels a coward for not going south to help despite his vows to the Watch.
The Lord Commander presents Jon with a gift for saving his life, his ancestral blade, Longclaw. It had passed to Jorah when Jeor took the black, but Jorah left it behind when he went into exile and Jeor put it away and largely forgot about it until he rediscovered it after the fire. The hilt had burned in the fire, but the Valyrian steel blade survived and a new hilt was crafted with a stone wolf replacing the original silver bear. Mormont has sent Ser Alliser to King's Landing with the hand of the wight Jafer Flowers to plead the case of the Night's Watch for more men. Ser Endrew Tarth will come from the Shadow Tower to replace him as master-at-arms. Mormont sends Jon for wine.
As Jon leaves the tower, Pyp, Todder, Grenn, Halder, and Matthar, surround him to see the sword, which they know about because Halder helped Pate carve the pommel, Sam bought the garnets for the hilt in Mole's Town, and Rudge helped Donal Noye reform the sword in the forge. As his friends jest, Jon thinks of the other wight, Jafer, who killed five men including Ser Jaremy before it was hacked to pieces. Ser Jaremy had cut off his head, but the headless corpse responded by killing him. Jon is melancholy because of his injury and the fighting in the riverlands and soon takes leave of his friends. He goes back to his room and shows Longclaw to Ghost. Sam comes to tell Jon that Maester Aemon wants to see him. Sam told the maester about telling Jon about Robb.
Jon finds the maester feeding the ravens with the help of Clydas, whom the maester sends away. Aemon talks of the vows of the Night's Watch and how important it is to place honor before love. When Aegon the Conqueror slew King Harren and conquered his kingdom, the Lord Commander of the Watch was his brother. Although Lord Commander Hoare had ten thousand swords, he did not march. When the Seven Kingdoms actually were seven and there was hardly a time three or four were not at war, the Watch did not take part. When the Andals came across the sea to destroy the kingdoms of the First Men, the Watch remained neutral. He tells Jon that he knows how he feels and how hard it is to keep the vows when tested, but Jon does not believe this, so Aemon tells his story. He was tested three times, but he chose his vows. Maesters give up their house names when they don the collar, but he was once Aemon Targaryen.","Daenerys rides her silver through a town of the Lhazareen newly taken by Drogo. Khal Ogo had arrived first to loot the town, but Drogo killed him and his son, Fogo, and integrated most of Ogo's khalasar into his own. Drogo plans to take the slaves to Meereen and sell them to buy ships to cross the sea to Westeros. Daenerys rides with Ser Jorah, Irri, Jhiqui, Doreah, Aggo, Jhogo, Quaro, and Rakharo to find Drogo. On the way, she sees a girl her age being raped1 and cannot stand the sight, telling Jorah and her khas to make it stop, which they do. Ser Jorah comments that she is truly like her brother Rhaegar. Daenerys leaves Doreah to tend to the girl and continues on, claiming every woman she sees being raped as she passes by.
Daenerys finally finds Drogo with his bloodriders, Cohollo, Haggo, and Qotho before a giant mud building with an onion dome. Drogo has an arrow in his arm and a cut on his chest. One of his riders, Mago, is complaining about Daenerys stopping him from raping the first girl that she claimed, but Drogo does not care. Daenerys soon realizes that Drogo's wounds are more serious than she was led to believe. She learns that Drogo has refused the healers and is about to send for them when one of the Lhazareen women she saved speaks up, saying she can help Drogo. She is Mirri Maz Duur, the godswife of the town's temple, which is dedicated to the Great Shepherd. Haggo names her maegi, a woman who lies with demons and practices the dark arts, but Mirri says she is a healer. Her mother was godswife before her and taught her of healing and she also traveled the East to learn the ways of the Dothraki, Jogos Nhai, and Asshai'i. She even studied with a maester of Westeros named Marwyn, who opened a body for her to examine. Daenerys convinces Drogo to let her heal him, and Mirri takes him inside the temple. She pulls out the arrow, stitches up his wounds, and applies a poultice which she says he must wear for ten days and nights. Afterwards, Daenerys asks her to be midwife when she gives birth.","Tyrion arrives late for dinner with Tywin and his commanders. Lord Leo Lefford, in charge of supplies, questions the use of arming Tyrion's clansmen. Ser Kevan states that Tywin wants to place them in the vanguard under Ser Gregor. Tyrion is not pleased, but sees no choice. He loses his appetite and leaves. He returns to his tent, where his new servants, a groom, a bodyservant, and his squire, Podrick Payne, have just finished eating. Bronn is also waiting with a camp follower named Shae. Tyrion had sent Bronn to bring him a likely whore. He takes Shae into his tent. She has a smart mouth, which Tyrion likes. He tells her that she will be his servant and companion for as long as he has use for her and will take no other men while in his service. She agrees, and they have sex, which Tyrion realizes he has missed greatly.
Early the next morning, trumpets sound as the men are called to form ranks for battle. He sends Podrick scurrying to get his armor. Bronn rides up and reports that the Stark army marched through the night and is now forming battle lines. Tyrion dons a mismatched suit of armor, as his personal armor is back at Casterly Rock, and rides off to join his men. Ser Kevan commands the center of the army, consisting largely of foot, and Ser Addam Marbrand has the right, with the main horse. Tyrion is on the left, commanded by Gregor. Lord Tywin commands the reserves, as he always does. Gregor positions Tyrion on the far left of the line. The left is composed of ill-disciplined freeriders and hedge knights with little infantry support. The Stark army advances, and Gregor orders a charge. The battle becomes a personal struggle. Tyrion kills one knight, causes another to yield, and takes a wound to the right arm before the battle moves past him. Kevan brings up the center in support and Tywin brings the reserve crashing through the Stark line, breaking it.
With the battle over, Tyrion gathers his men. Shagga was wounded, but survives, Chella and Timett are unharmed, and Conn and Ulf are dead. In all, about half of the three hundred clansmen survived. Tyrion goes to find his father, furious because he knows now that he was placed on the left to die. Tywin confirms that the left was supposed to collapse and draw the Stark army in so that Kevan could flank them. Ser Addam rides up and reports that several battle commanders were captured, including Medger Cerwyn, Wylis Manderly, Harrion Karstark, and four Freys.1 Lord Halys Hornwood was killed. He also reports that Robb was not with the army and moved on Riverrun with his horse.","Catelyn sits on her horse surrounded by thirty men led by Hallis Mollen who are to take her back to Winterfell if the coming battle goes ill. Robb moves among the men preparing for battle. Ser Brynden has reported that Jaime does not know they are there. Jaime has twelve thousand foot and two or three thousand horse in three separate camps besieging Riverrun. Lord Jason Mallister has joined his strength to Robb, and remnants of Edmure's host that retreated after the battle before Riverrun have also augmented his force. Robb mounts as Olyvar holds his horse. He rides down the line with Grey Wind and his thirty battle companions, including the sons of several great lords, Torrhen and Eddard Karstark, Patrek Mallister, Smalljon Umber, Daryn Hornwood, Theon Greyjoy, Wendel Manderly, Robin Flint, and five Freys. Also with him is Dacey Mormont, Lady Maege's eldest daughter who has been trained as a warrior. They hear Jaime ride out on one of his frequent raids and Robb prepares his trap.
Catelyn watches Robb ride off and then listens to the battle unfold. At its conclusion, Robb rides back to her with Theon, Galbart, and the Greatjon to present Jaime Lannister, his new prisoner. Jaime killed Eddard, Torrhen, and Daryn trying to reach Robb before he was captured. In addition to Jaime, Robb's forces captured Lord Gawen Westerling, Lord Quenten Banefort, Lord Regenard Estren, Willem Lannister, Ser Garth Greenfield, Ser Tytos Brax, Mallor the Dornishman, and Cleos and Tion Frey.1","Drogo has not been following Mirri's instructions, and he is slowly dying. He ripped off the poultice she gave him because it itched. The herbwomen made him a new one with mud that was more soothing, but it has not been helping. Daenerys tries to get his attention as they ride, and he falls off his horse. Cohollo, Haggo, and Qotho ride up. Daenerys tells them they must halt and camp and sends Qotho to fetch Mirri, which he does only reluctantly. Irri and Doreah help Daenerys carry Drogo into his tent and Eroeh lights the braziers. Doreah and Jhiqui get him undressed. Aggo, Jhogo, Quaro, and Rakharo guard the entrance to the tent so no one will see him in his weak state. Jorah arrives and tells Daenerys to send her maids away. He peels the poultice and sees that the wound has festered terribly. He tells Daenerys that Drogo is as good as dead and they must flee before he dies. He says that Jhaqo and Pono and the other kos of the khalasar will fight to lead the khalasar and the winner will kill her child to eliminate a future rival.
Mirri arrives and tells Daenerys that Drogo will be dead by morning. Daenerys begs Mirri to save him, and Mirri says there is a way, a bloodmagic ritual, but there will be a price to pay: death. Daenerys tells her to do it. Mirri sends everybody out and tells Daenerys no one may enter once she begins. After Daenerys leaves, Mirri begins singing and dancing, and she does not seem to be dancing alone. Drogo's bloodriders return and are horrified. Qotho makes for the tent. Quaro tries to stop him, but Qotho kills him. Jorah moves against him. Qotho wounds him in several places, but Jorah gets a good blow in and kills him. Rakharo and Jhogo take down Haggo. Cohollo grabs Daenerys, but Aggo kills him with an arrow. Daenerys has gone into labor. Jorah screams for the birthing women, but they will not come. Seeing no other choice, he takes her into Drogo's tent.","Arya has been hiding in King's Landing since her escape from the castle. She catches pigeons and trades them for soup in the Flea Bottom neighborhood of the city. She has checked the gates, but they are all guarded. All of her possessions have been stolen save for the clothes on her back, her wooden sword, and Needle. She goes to the docks one day and sees that the Wind Witch is still in port with Stark guardsmen on deck. She almost goes to them, but realizes at the last moment that none of the guards are her father's men, and it is a trap. As she returns to Flea Bottom from the docks, she hears a bell begin to ring. It is a summoning to the Great Sept, where Eddard is going to make an appearance.
Arya goes to the sept with the rest of the city. She climbs a statue and sees Eddard with the High Septon standing behind him. Many high lords are present, as well as Joffrey and Cersei flanked by five Kingsguard including Sandor; Varys; Petyr; and Sansa.1 Eddard confesses to plotting to dethrone Joffrey and take the throne, and he proclaims Joffrey the true king. Joffrey then says that his mother wants Eddard to be allowed to join the Night's Watch, but he will take Eddard's head. Sansa screams and Ser Ilyn comes forward to see it done with Ice as a man in black and red armor holds him down.2 Arya desperately tries to reach him, but the crowd is too thick. Suddenly, a man grabs her and a voice tells her not to look. When it is done, she looks up and sees that the man is Yoren. He shoves her into a doorway and pulls a knife.","Bran, Summer, and Maester Luwin watch Ser Rodrik train new recruits. Bran says that if he were trained to use a poleaxe, he could fight using Hodor as his legs. Luwin replies that a man's arms, legs, and thoughts must be one in battle. Bran brings up Symeon Star-Eyes, a knight who supposedly fought blind and replaced his eyes with sapphires, but Luwin says that Symeon, like Florian the Fool and countless others, is merely a legend from the Age of Heroes. Bran tells the maester that he had the crow dream again, in which he went down to the crypts and talked to Eddard. Eddard seemed sad; it had something to do with Jon. Bran tried to go down to the crypts when he awoke, but Hodor would not enter. Maester Luwin summons Osha to carry Bran and goes down to the crypts with him.
As they proceed through the crypts, Maester Luwin has Bran tell Osha about the people whose graves they pass. Jon Stark defeated the sea raiders when they landed in the east and built the castle at White Harbor. His son, Rickard, took the Neck from the Marsh King and married the king's daughter. Theon Stark was called the Hungry Wolf because he was always at war. Brandon the Shipwright loved the sea and was lost sailing far to the west. His son, Brandon the Burner, burnt all his father's ships in his grief. Rodrik Stark won Bear Island in a wrestling match and granted it to House Mormont. Torrhen Stark is known as the King Who Knelt for yielding to Aegon the Conqueror. Cregan Stark was considered a fine swordsman and once fought Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. Lord Rickard Stark was executed by King Aerys II. Brandon and Lyanna also have statues, even though by tradition only the kings and lords get them, because Eddard loved them so much. They finally arrive at Eddard's grave, and Shaggydog suddenly leaps at Maester Luwin and savages his arm before Summer intervenes and Rickon calls him off. Rickon is here because he had the same dream as Bran. They convince him to come back to Maester Luwin's tower with them, where Osha bandages the maester's wound.
Osha brings up the children of the forest and Maester Luwin brings out a jar of dragonglass arrowheads to show Bran and Rickon. He says that the children worked no metal and wore clothes made of leaves and bark and wielded weapons made of dragonglass. Bran asks the maester to tell him all about the children. Maester Luwin says no one knows how long they lived in Westeros, but their domination ended with the arrival of the First Men twelve thousand years ago, who began to clear away the trees for fields. After years of war, a pact was forged on the Isle of Faces in which the First Men agreed to chop down no more trees and live in peace. This is considered the end of the Dawn Age and the beginning of the Age of Heroes. The pact endured through the Age of Heroes, the Long Night, and the founding of the Seven Kingdoms until the Andals arrived in Westeros four thousand years later. Before Maester Luwin can finish the story, he is interrupted by Summer howling. A raven arrives at the window with a message reporting Eddard's death.","Sansa stays in her room for days weeping and shivering in grief and reliving the moment when Janos Slynt held her father down and Ser Ilyn chopped off his head. Finally, Joffrey comes for her with Sandor, Ser Arys and Ser Meryn to tell her she will attend him. She refuses initially, and Joffrey makes Sandor get her dressed. She says she wants to go home, and Joffrey says they are still to be married. She says she hates him, and Joffrey has Ser Meryn hit her. He leaves then, and Sansa bathes and dresses. Ser Meryn comes back to escort her to Joffrey. She tells him he is no true knight, but he simply does not care.
Sansa attends court, where Joffrey sits in judgment with Cersei, Varys, Petyr, and Janos. He lets them handle most of the cases, but when he intervenes, it is always to give out bloody punishments. When it is over, he comes to her with Ser Meryn and Sandor and takes her to the battlements to see the traitors' heads. On the way, he says he will get her with child as soon as she is able, and if the child is stupid he will kill them both and get a new wife. Eddard's head is up there, as is Septa Mordane's and several others. There are two empty spikes for Renly and Stannis. Joffrey tells Sansa of Jaime's capture and tells her he will raise a host and bring her Robb's head. Sansa retorts that Robb may bring her Joffrey's head, and he has Ser Meryn beat her again. She considers pushing Joffrey off the battlements, but Sandor kneels before her and delicately wipes the blood from her face, and the moment passes.","Daenerys sleeps and has strange dreams of Drogo having sex with her, of Viserys talking of waking dragons, of her son, tall and proud with bronze skin and white hair, consumed in flame, and of Rhaegar, yet when she opens his visor she sees her own face. She awakens very weak and tries to reach her dragon eggs. Irri, Jhiqui, and Doreah are there, as are Rakharo and Mirri Maz Duur. Jorah comes and takes her back to her bed. She sleeps again, and when she wakes she asks to hold an egg before going back to sleep. The third time she stays awake and asks for Jorah. Her egg is warm to the touch, but when Jorah arrives with Mirri and Daenerys asks him to feel it, he only feels cold stone. She feels different, all her fear gone.
Daenerys learns her son is dead; he came out of the womb twisted and seeming to have died years ago. Entering the tent killed her son; it was the price for Drogo's life. She tells Mirri to show her Drogo. When they get outside, they see Aggo, Jhogo, Rakharo, and about a hundred old men, women and children. The rest are gone. Pono declared himself a khal first and left with many others; next Jhaqo did the same with twenty thousand men. Nearly a dozen new khalasars were formed in all. They took the livestock and the slaves. Mago, now a bloodrider to Jhaqo, and several others took Eroeh and raped her then slit her throat. Daenerys says they will both pay. Mirri takes her to Drogo. He is blind, deaf and does not respond to anything. Daenerys is furious at Mirri, and Mirri explains that she did it for revenge and to rid the world of the stallion that mounts the world. Daenerys orders her bound hand and foot and carried away. That night, she takes Drogo out into the grass and uses every sexual trick she knows to try and revive him. When all fails, she smothers him.","Lord Tywin and his lords bannermen and retainers, including Ser Kevan, Ser Addam, Ser Flement, Ser Harys Swyft, Ser Gregor, Lord Leo and Tyrion receive a messenger from Riverrun. Tywin has been marching south at a relentless pace, leaving many wounded along the side of the road to die, trying to reach Riverrun. The messenger reports that Jaime has been captured and his army destroyed. The north camp fell first. It started with Ser Brynden leading the van, taking out the sentries, and clearing the palisades. Then, Robb personally led the main force and the Greatjon fired the siege engines. Lord Tytos completed the trap by leading a sortie from Riverrun to take the Lannisters in the rear. Ser Edmure was freed, along with many other captives. At the west camp, Lord Andros Brax was killed trying to cross the river as his camp was surrounded. Ser Forley Prester was able to extricate his men from the south camp, but the Tyroshi sellsword leading his freeriders changed sides.
Tywin's lords are horrified. Ser Addam wants to march against Robb, but Ser Harys and Lord Leo think that peace must be forged. Tyrion points out that killing Eddard eliminated any chance of that. Finally, Lord Tywin speaks up and commands everyone to leave save Tyrion and Kevan. Tywin reveals that Renly has married Margaery Tyrell and claimed the throne with the might of Highgarden at his back. Stannis continues to sit at Dragonstone, but Varys hears rumors of various sorts, including that he is building ships, that he is hiring sellswords, and even that he brought in a shadowbinder from Asshai.1 Tywin's army is now in a precarious position. Robb holds the Twins and Moat Cailin and blocks the route back to Lannisport. With Renly massing in the south and Stannis at Dragonstone, there is a risk of being caught between three armies.
Tywin decides he must deal with Robb before Renly can march. He decides to regroup at Harrenhal. Ser Addam will screen the army, while Ser Gregor, Ser Amory Lorch, and Vargo Hoat set the Riverlands aflame. Meanwhile, Tyrion will go to King's Landing to rule. Tywin is disgusted with the recent activities of Joffrey such as elevating Janos to a lordship and dismissing Ser Barristan. He orders Tyrion to take Joffrey in hand and deal with the small council. When Tyrion asks why Tywin is suddenly giving him such responsibility, he replies that Tyrion is his son. At that point Tyrion realizes that Tywin has given up Jaime for lost and hates him for it. Tywin orders him not to bring Shae to court and then dismisses him. He returns to his room and Shae and tells her they are going to King's Landing.","Jon prepares a horse to leave Castle Black as Sam tries to stop him. Preparations complete, he calls Ghost and gallops past Sam into the night, nearly running Sam down before he jumps out of the way. Jon has chosen the life of an outcast for the chance to avenge his father at Robb's side. Ghost keeps pace with him for a while and then goes off on his own and does not come when Jon calls for him. He stops to eat and hears horses coming. He gets off the road just before Grenn, Halder, Pyp, Matthar, and Todder ride up.1 Sam must have told them what he was doing. Ghost betrays his position to them, and they coerce him into coming back.
The next morning, Jon fetches Lord Commander Mormont's breakfast from Hobb and takes it to him. Jeor chastises him for running, saying he knew it would happen, and he had been observed leaving. He tells Jon that the war affects everyone, and he is not special. He also tells him of darker tidings. Cotter Pyke reports elk and mammoths fleeing south. Ser Denys Mallister reports abandoned wildling villages and seeing huge fires in the night, and Qhorin Halfhand has caught a wildling who states that Mance Rayder is gathering all his people at a new stronghold. Many rangers have gone missing in the past year and now the dead have been seen to walk. Lord Commander Mormont is personally going to lead a large expedition beyond the Wall to find Benjen Stark and discover what is going on. By tradition, the Lord Commander's steward is also his squire, but he says he will not take Jon if he just plans to run off again. Jon reluctantly lets go of his father and siblings and promises not to run again.","Robb and Catelyn prepare to enter Riverrun by boat. Theon and Grey Wind are in the boat with them, and the Greatjon, Lord Rickard, and Ser Brynden are in the next boat. They are greeted by Ser Edmure, Lord Tytos, and Utherydes Wayn who offer condolences to Catelyn for Eddard's death. Edmure takes Catelyn to see Hoster, who is dying. He is happy to see her, but seems extremely disappointed that Lysa did not come too.1 He also asks if Brynden has wed yet, as his refusal to marry Bethany Redwyne at Hoster's order is the main cause of their quarrel. She goes looking for Robb and finds him praying in the godswood, so she waits. When he is done, he comes and tells her that Renly has declared himself king and he must call a council to decide what to do.
The great lords all gather. Hoster is too sick, so Edmure is there for him with Ser Brynden at his side. Arrayed around him are Lord Jonos, Lord Tytos, Lord Jason, Ser Marq, Ser Stevron, Karyl Vance, now a lord with the death of his father, and Lyman Darry, son of the late Ser Raymun. All the lords of the north are there too, Robb, Theon, Rickard, Maege, Galbart, and the Greatjon. Roose has reported that he has reformed his army at the causeway before Moat Cailin, while Lord Tywin has crossed the Trident and is making for Harrenhal. There is great disagreement over what to do next. Ser Marq urges a strike at Casterly Rock, while Lord Tytos wants to finish Tywin at Harrenhal. Lord Jonos feels they should declare for Renly and squeeze Tywin between them, and Lord Jason says they should bide their time since they are blocking Tywin's line of supply. Ser Stevron thinks they should make peace and see who wins between Joffrey and Renly, but is shouted down. Robb is undecided. Joffrey is the true king, but he cannot bow to the Lannisters with his father executed. Renly has the might of the Reach and the Stormlands, but Stannis has the better claim. Catelyn makes an impassioned plea for peace, but she is shouted down. Finally, the Greatjon jumps up and says he has had his fill of these kings; he will bow to Robb as the King in the North. Soon, all the lords of the north and the riverlands alike are rising to their feet and offering fealty to Robb.","Daenerys sends her people to find wood for a pyre. She has Aggo slay one of the best horses remaining and add it to the wood. She then lays Drogo on the pyre with all his most prized possessions. Ser Jorah comes to her and tells her not to sacrifice herself, but she assures him that is not her intent. She names the remaining Dothraki her khalasar and frees those that are slaves. She next gives Jhogo the whip that was her bridal gift and names him ko and asks him to be her bloodrider. He refuses because she is a woman, but she presses on, gifting Aggo the bow and Rakharo the arakh and asking the same, but they both also refuse. She next turns to Ser Jorah, who swears an oath of fealty to her as queen, and names him the first of her Queensguard. Next, she has Irri, Jhiqui and Doreah bathe her and dress her before bathing and dressing Drogo's corpse. She has him placed on the pyre and then has her dragon eggs arrayed around him. Mirri Maz Duur, still bound, says she is mad, but Daenerys disagrees and then has the woman placed on the pyre too. A red comet appears in the sky right before she gives the order to light the pyre. As Drogo burns and Mirri dies, Daenerys walks into the fire, yet is not burned by it. Three large cracks are heard as her dragon eggs hatch. When it is over, Daenerys's clothes and hair have been entirely burned away, but she is unhurt and suckling her dragons1 at her breasts. Aggo, Jhogo and Rakharo quickly swear themselves to her as for the first time in hundreds of years, the night comes alive with the song of dragons."
