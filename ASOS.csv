"Chett, Lark, and Small Paul are out hunting with the dogs, which refuse to track a bear whose paw print they have discovered.1 The discussion turns to a planned desertion that night. They plan to kill Lord Commander Mormont and Blane, Grubbs and Aethan because they are on watch, Dywen and Bannen because they are the best trackers, and Sam because he controls the ravens. They are striking now because three days past Thoren's patrol, consisting of Kedge Whiteye, Bannen, Goady, and Tumberjon, returned with word that the wildlings are moving down the Milkwater, twenty or thirty thousand of them. Harma Dogshead has the van with five hundred horse. Sweet Donnel Hill, Ser Mallador's squire, told Chett that Thoren wants to attack the wildlings since they are burdened with women and children and not expecting resistance. Ser Mallador agrees, and they are trying to convince Lord Commander Mormont, while Ser Ottyn counsels retreat. Lord Commander Mormont is waiting for Jarmen's and Qhorin's patrols to return before making a decision, but they are both overdue. Chett has fourteen men in his conspiracy, including Lark, Small Paul, Kedge, Donnel, Dirk, Clubfoot Karl, Softfoot, and Ollo Lophand. Chett will kill Sam and scatter the ravens, Softfoot and Small Paul will kill Lord Commander Mormont, Dirk will take Blane, Lark and his cousins will do Bannen and Dywen, and Donnel and Karl will take care of the horses. Chett figures that Ser Ottyn will be given command and bid a hasty retreat for the Wall without stopping to hunt the deserters. Lark says he plans to go home after the desertion, which Chett thinks is stupid because all will know him for a deserter. Ollo means to go to Tyrosh, which Chett also considered, but he had only been a leech collector with his father back home in Hag's Mire and does not have a trade to practice in Tyrosh. He does not want to go home either and thinks that maybe he can kill Craster and take over the man's keep. He likes the idea of having Craster's wives, as the only women he had ever known were the whores of Mole's Town. In Hag's Mire, his boils had frightened the girls away, even a slut named Bessa who had lain with all the boys. He spent a day picking wildflowers for her, and when she refused and laughed at him, he killed her. He was caught near Sevenstreams, and one of Lord Walder Frey's bastards judged him guilty and sent him to the Wall.
The group returns to the Fist. Chett stops to watch Sam take archery practice at the foot of the hill. He has a bitter hatred for Sam for taking his place with Maester Aemon. Sam's first arrow misses completely. Dolorous Edd and Grenn cheer him on, but his second arrow goes wide too. After the third arrow hits and Sam is beaming, Chett tries to take him down with a cutting remark, but Edd gets the better of him. After reporting to Lord Commander Mormont, Chett makes a circuit of the camp, listening to what the men have to say. He gets dinner from Hake, while Dywen expresses worry that he can hear no animals around them. Chett joins a group that includes four of his conspirators. Both Dirk and Donnel seem at ease, but Sawwood and Maslyn are showing signs of nervousness. A call goes out for the men of the Watch to assemble at the central fire, where Lord Commander Mormont is flanked by Thoren, Ser Mallador, Ser Ottyn, and Blane. Chett takes a spot next to Brown Bernarr and waits. Lord Commander Mormont announces that the wildlings are coming, and he means to ambush them on their march. The men waver at first, but Mormont leads them in the oath of the Watch to raise their spirits. Chett notices with approval that Lark, Softfoot, and Donnel join in fervently. After the men are dismissed, it begins snowing. Chett panics, because snow will ruin all their plans. He decides to kill Sam anyway. Just as he is about to close in for the kill, a single horn blast sounds and wakes Sam up. Soon after, there is a second blast, which is followed by a third, the signal for Others approaching. Chett wets himself in fear.","Jaime revels in the first dawn he has seen in a long time as Brienne and Ser Cleos row down the Red Fork. Catelyn released him after he promised to return to King's Landing and convince Tyrion to release Sansa and Arya. He is being kept in chains, however. Jaime bandies words back and forth with Brienne, who considers him a monster. The wind shifts, and they raise the sail. Jaime has Ser Cleos shave his head, figuring that being bald with a beard will make him unrecognizable until they reach safety. Jaime watches the scenery roll by and beholds abandoned and ruined villages. They come across a group of women hanging from a tree, and Brienne insists on stopping to bury them. They are serving girls and whores that served Lannister soldiers. Just as they are beginning, Brienne spots a sail, and they hurry back to the boat. Jaime spies a Tully sail, and the chase is on. The other ship is a river galley and quickly catches up. Ser Robin is commanding. He orders them to throw their weapons over the side and prepare to be boarded. Brienne tells Ser Cleos to take the tiller and dives into the water. She climbs a cliff on the bank and sends a boulder crashing down on the galley. It splits in two, with one half taking out the sail and the other half puncturing the hull. The galley is finished. Jaime thinks that he is free of Brienne as well, but she catches up with the boat and gets back in.","Ser Desmond and Utherydes meet with Catelyn and try to decide what must be done with her. They do not want to put her in chains, but they decide she must be confined to a cell until Edmure returns. She suggests her father's chambers instead so she can comfort him in his final days, and they consent. Lord Hoster is sleeping when Catelyn arrives in his chambers. He wakes up when she speaks and calls her Tansy, not knowing who she is. Catelyn asks who Tansy is, and Hoster answers that she will have many trueborn sons.1 Maester Vyman comes in to put him back to sleep. Catelyn asks if he knows any Tansy, but he does not. That evening, he returns with a meal and word that Utherydes is quite sure that no one named Tansy has ever worked at the castle. Catelyn had noticed the arrival of a raven earlier and asks what news it brought. Maester Vyman tells her it is from Robb. He took a wound storming the Crag, but it is not serious. Catelyn puzzles on what her father said and concludes that Lysa must have lost a child before Lord Hoster made Lord Jon marry her as his price for adding his strength to Robert's Rebellion. She writes a letter to Lysa urging her to come or at least send a letter and gives it to the maester. Later that day, a commotion outside heralds Edmure's return. Two hours later, he comes to her. He informs her of Stannis's defeat and berates her for freeing Jaime. He tells her that he has sent ravens off to Lord Roose at Harrenhal telling him to be on guard and offered a thousand gold dragons for his recapture. Catelyn, lost in her grief anew tells him to leave.","Arya, Gendry, and Hot Pie travel north from Harrenhal cross country. Arya means to hit the Trident and then follow it to Riverrun. When they finally stop to rest, Arya enters Nymeria in her dreams. Nymeria and her pack ambush four Brave Companions, including Iggo, and kill them all.","Tyrion awakens when Bronn enters his room. Tyrion says he summoned him days ago and Bronn says he was there twice, but Tyrion was dead to the world. Tyrion notices the sigil on his chest, and Bronn tells him he is now Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. He gives Tyrion more details of the battle and its aftermath. When Joffrey was led back to the Red Keep, the goldcloaks began to desert. Lord Jacelyn attempted to get them back to the walls and almost succeeded until someone shot him in the neck and he was dragged from his horse and killed. Ser Addam commands the city watch now. Shagga remains in the kingswood, while Timett has returned to the mountains. Chella tried to reenter the city but was driven off. Cersei released Alayaya after whipping her. Tommen is back in the city; with Jacelyn dead, Cersei sent the Kettleblacks to fetch him back from Rosby. Osney and Osfryd have both been knighted and none of the three Kettleblacks are in Tyrion's employ any longer. Lord Randyll is marching to Duskendale to counter Robett's force. Tyrion's sellsword army is gone, those that did not die were paid and put out by Ser Kevan.
Tyrion tells Bronn that he wants to know everything about Ser Mandon and then has the sellsword help him up. He calls for Podrick and has him bring clothes. They walk to the gate, where Ser Meryn has the guard. At first, he refuses to let Tyrion pass, but Tyrion says he has business with Lord Tywin, and Ser Meryn lowers the drawbridge. Ser Osmund guards the other end of the bridge. Tyrion is so weak by this point that Bronn has to carry him up the steps of the Tower of the Hand. They pass Ser Addam on the way up. He tells Tyrion that Lord Tywin is in a foul mood because they still have not found Tyrek. When Tyrion enters Lord Tywin's solar, Lord Tywin dismisses Bronn and Podrick so they may speak alone. Tywin is cold and abrupt with Tyrion. He belittles Tyrion's part in the battle and is annoyed that Tyrion promised Prince Doran that Gregor would be brought to justice. He dismisses Tyrion, but instead of leaving, Tyrion demands that Tywin acknowledge him as his son and heir to Casterly Rock. Tywin tells Tyrion that he will never get the Rock, he who killed his mother coming into the world and continues to shame House Lannister with his whores. It was Tywin that had Alayaya beaten. The next time he finds Tyrion with a whore, he will hang her.","Davos watches on his tiny rock as a ship approaches.1 He has been on the island for days and is weak from sickness and hunger. He considers letting the ship pass and dying in peace. Finally, he decides to hail it. He is noticed and rescued.","Sansa has received a dinner invitation from the newly-arrived Margaery. She worries about what it portends, but she accepts. On the appointed night, Ser Loras arrives to escort her. He informs her that, Margaery's grandmother, Olenna, will be there as well. Ser Balon opens the gate to Maegor's Holdfast, and they pass through. In the yard, a group of men are practicing swords, including Ser Hobber, Ser Tallad, Ser Kennos of Kayce, Ser Osney, Ser Osfryd, and Lord Morros. She notes one knight training against three men. It is Ser Garlan, Loras's brother. Loras admits that his brother is better with the sword, though not with the lance. Sansa mentions the Hand's tournament and the red rose Loras gave her,1 but Loras does not even remember, though he tries to hide it. She says it was after he unhorsed Ser Robar, and Loras laments that he killed Robar at Storm's End. They arrive at the doors to the Tyrell chambers, which are guarded by Olenna's twin guards Erryk and Arryk, whom she just calls Left and Right because she can never tell them apart. Margaery greets her at the gate and bids her welcome. She takes Sansa to the dinner table and introduces her to the gathered ladies: Lady Alerie Tyrell, Megga Tyrell, Alla Tyrell, Elinor Tyrell, Lady Janna Fossoway, Leonette Tyrell, Septa Nysterica, Lady Alyce Graceford, Lady Alysanne Bulwer, Meredyth Crane, Lady Taena Merryweather, and Lady Olenna Tyrell. Olenna has some choice words to say about her son, whom she calls Lord Oaf and Lord Puff Fish, and getting mixed up with Renly before having Sansa sit next to her and summoning Butterbumps to entertain. After the first course is brought out, Olenna tells Sansa to tell her about Joffrey. Sansa is terrified and tries to dodge the question. Olenna finally has Butterbumps sing ""The Bear and the Maiden Fair"" so that no one will hear their conversation. Finally, Sansa tells Olenna and Margaery that Joffrey is a monster. Olenna says that is a pity.2 Margaery asks if Sansa would like to visit Highgarden. She says she would, but the queen will never let her go. Olenna says she will if Lord Mace asks it. Olenna means to see her wed. At first, Sansa thinks they mean Loras and is thrilled, but Olenna says she means Mace's eldest son Willas, who was crippled as a squire in his first tournament by Oberyn Martell. Sansa is less sure of that match. They finish talking as the song comes to an end.","Jon and Ghost enter the main wildling camp with Rattleshirt's party, including Ygritte, Lenyl, Ragwyle, Longspear Ryk, and Orell, trapped in his eagle. They are met at the edge of the camp by a group of outriders led by the Weeper, who tells them to take Jon to Mance. They enter his tent, where a singer is performing while two men study a map. Jon mistakes one of them for Mance, but he is actually the singer. Mance introduces himself and recognizes Jon. He introduces the others present, Styr, Magnar of Thenn, Tormund Giantsbane, Mance's wife Dalla, who is pregnant with his child, Dalla's sister Val, and Val's current lover, Jarl. Mance asks him why he is there, and Jon lies that Qhorin was just on a ranging from the Shadow Tower. Mance sends the others away to talk further. He tells Jon that he knows him because he has seen him twice. The first time was when he was in the Watch and escorted the old lord commander, Qorgyle, to Winterfell. The second time was the welcoming feast for King Robert, which he secretly attended. Mance tells Jon the story of why he left the Watch. He was wounded by a shadowcat while on a ranging and, fearing they would not reach Maester Mullin at the Shadow Tower in time, his brothers took him to be healed by a wildling woman who also patched his black cloak with red thread. When he returned to the Shadow Tower, they refused to let him wear the cloak. Jon tells him that he deserted because of the low regard he was given as a bastard. Mance accepts him.","Daenerys stands at the prow of Balerion and watches Rhaegal and Viserion chase each other across the sky. Captain Groleo joins her and laments the lack of any wind the past seven days to speed them towards Pentos. Ser Jorah joins her, followed by Arstan, who tells her a little about the Targaryen dragons of old, stating that Balerion was two hundred years old when he died during the reign of Jaehaerys I and claiming that a dragon will never stop growing as long as it has food and freedom. Daenerys asks how that can be, and Arstan responds that the dragons raised in the Dragonpit were never as large as their ancestors and that the maesters said this was because of the walls and dome that contained them.1 He goes on to speak of Aerys II and Rhaegar at Daenerys's urging. He says Aerys was often pleasant, though harsh on those he saw as enemies, and calls Rhaegar a man no one really knew, but one whom he personally saw in tournaments and playing his silver harp. A disdainful Jorah retorts that anyone from the period knows that and that Arstan will next claim he squired for the prince. Arstan says he would make no such claim, stating that Myles Mooton was Rhaegar's squire and Richard Lonmouth after him, both of which Rhaegar knighted and both of which remained his close companions. Lord Jon Connington was also a close friend, but his oldest friend was Ser Arthur Dayne. Rhaegar was a puissant warrior, good with sword and lance, but in his youth he was more bookish, with men saying Queen Rhaella must have swallowed some books and a candle while he was in the womb. The maesters were amazed by his intellect, but he had no interest in fighting, and many worried he was Baelor the Blessed come again. One day, he apparently read something in his scrolls, though no one knows what, and then presented himself to the master-at-arms, Ser Willem Darry, and asked for sword and armor, for he needed to become a warrior. Arstan halts there when he sees that Belwas has woken up and goes to attend him. Ser Jorah cautions Daenerys that Arstan may be hiding something. The wind finally picks up.
That night, Ser Jorah comes to her chambers. Daenerys shows him that she has taught her dragons to breathe fire on command by tossing a piece of meat to Drogon and saying dracarys, the Valyrian word for dragonfire. Ser Jorah wants to talk alone, and Daenerys sends Irri and Jhiqui away. Ser Jorah repeats his mistrust of Arstan, Belwas, and Illyrio and suggests that they go overland to Pentos from Slaver's Bay. Telling the captains to put ashore there will be a good test of their loyalty, and they can buy Unsullied in Astapor so that she has an army at her back when she returns to Pentos. Daenerys wonders why she would want Unsullied, and Ser Jorah tells her the tale of the three thousand of Qohor. Four hundred years ago, the Dothraki rode out of the east for the first time to pillage and burn. They were led by Khal Temmo, who commanded over fifty thousand, half of them warriors. The people of Qohor knew of the threat and responded by strengthening their walls, doubling the guard, hiring the sellsword companies the Bright Banners and the Second Sons, and, as an afterthought, hiring three thousand Unsullied from Astapor. When the Unsullied arrived, the battle was already joined and the sellswords had already fled. The next morning, the three thousand lined up before the gates, the only thing between Temmo and the city. They could have been flanked, but Dothraki are disdainful of foot soldiers, who are only fit to be run down. Eighteen times the Dothraki charged, and eighteen times they were sent reeling. Though reduced to six hundred, they killed 12,000 Dothraki, including Temmo, his bloodriders, his kos, and his sons. On the fourth day of fighting, the new khal brought his riders past the gates in a procession, and one by one they cut off their braids and laid them at the feet of the Unsullied before riding off. Jorah says they can pay using Illyrio's trade goods, which will be another good test of his dedication to her cause. Daenerys agrees that this is a good idea. She begins to dress, when Ser Jorah pulls her close and kisses her. He professes his love and says she should take him as husband and dragonrider because no one will be truer to her and her cause then him.","Bran is running through the woods inside Summer. Just as he steals a kill from a pack of wolves, Hodor wakes him up. Jojen admonishes him for becoming lost in his wolf self and not remembering to do things like mark trees so they know where Summer's kills are. Bran is sullen; he wishes that he never had to leave Summer. Meera returns with fish and frogs for dinner. Jojen says they should move on. They have been staying in an abandoned tower for several days, but Jojen is not convinced it is safe. He wants to go beyond the Wall and find the three-eyed crow. Meera finds this idea foolish since they have no idea where to look. Bran says they should sail down the White Knife to White Harbor, but he is ignored as usual. Bran asks why they need to find the crow anyway. Jojen says that Bran has opened his third eye, but he is still not in control of his gift. Winter is coming, and Bran will be needed. Meera comes around, but she tells Bran it should be his decision. He decides they should find the crow.","Davos watches from on deck as Shayala's Dance approaches Dragonstone. The sounds of the boat remind him of his youth as a smuggler and the sea watch, commanded by Ser Tristimun that was ruthlessly efficient at catching smugglers in Aerys II's day. The captain of the ship, a Lyseni named Khorane Sathmantes, has been kind to him on the voyage, giving him use of his cabin and clothes. He also spoke of the battle and how Renly's ghost led the van of Lord Tywin's army.1 Few remained loyal, mostly Florents. Lord Alester is now Hand of the King. Khorane comes up to say they have arrived and that Salladhor will want to see him. Davos says he must see Stannis, but Khorane explains that no one sees him anymore. Davos finds Salladhor on a Pentoshi trader called Bountiful Harvest. Salladhor is overjoyed to see him and orders one of his eunuchs, Meizo Mahr, to show him to the owner's cabin and get him refreshments.
Salladhor arrives soon after and explains that Lord Alester made him Lord of Blackwater Bay and gave him leave to collect duties from passing ships. He seizes those that do not pay, such as Bountiful Harvest, which is owned by Illyrio Mopatis. He tells Davos that some of Stannis's ships escaped the fire, including Lord Steffon, Ragged Jenna, Swift Sword, and Laughing Lord. They were all trapped upriver by the chain and most of them were captured or scuttled. Ragged Jenna and Laughing Lord are still on the river acting as raiders. Lady Marya and Wraith did not survive, and both Dale and Allard are dead. Devan, however, survived. Salladhor offers Davos a ship and a place in his fleet, but Davos declines. He wants to see Stannis, but Salladhor repeats that he sees no one. Queen Selyse has given Lord Alester the title of Hand and granted him use of the king's seal, and they run the realm. Stannis closets himself with Melisandre and watches the flames. Davos thinks that she sent the flames at King's Landing and sent Stannis, and his sons, to their deaths to show that she is indispensible. Davos declares his intention to kill her. Salladhor tries to dissuade him, telling him that Melisandre has been burning traitors in her fires, including Lord Guncer and Ser Hubard's sons. Davos will not be turned aside and leaves.
At the gate to Dragonstone, Davos is refused admittance. He asks if Jate Blackberry is still captain of the gate, but he is dead. He asks next after Lord Chyttering, but he died on the Blackwater. Davos names off two more guards, Hookface Will and Hal the Hog, but they are dead too. The guard finally goes to get instructions and returns to lets him in. He is escorted to a garden by Florent guardsmen and instructed to wait. Patchface and Shireen come through. Patchface stops for a second when he sees Davos and utters a strange rhyme: Fool's blood, king's blood, blood on the maiden's thigh, but chains for the guests and chains for the bridegroom, aye aye aye.""2 Edric barrels into him soon after. He asks who Davos is and says that Stannis should not have cut off his fingers when he learns he is the knight of onions. Just then, Ser Axell comes to take him to the dungeon for plotting to kill Melisandre.","Brienne, Ser Cleos, and Jaime stop at an inn by the riverside that is still standing. It is the Inn of the Kneeling Man, which purportedly stands on the exact spot where King Torrhen knelt to King Aegon. When Jaime opens the door, he is confronted by a boy with a crossbow.1 He lets them enter as long as they leave their swords at the door. A man comes up and offers food.2 He is not the innkeeper; he and his wife3 discovered the innkeeper and his women dead, buried them, and took over the place themselves. The boy is not theirs. He lost his two boys and the Brave Companions killed the boy's parents, so they took him in. He cooks them some dinner and asks for news. When he learns that they are heading downriver, he tells them they will never make it because two sunken ships are blocking the way and there are outlaws further down. Lord Beric and Thoros are still causing trouble as well. Jaime realizes that their best chance is to strike overland, and Brienne reluctantly agrees. They end up buying three horses from the man, a plow horse, an old gelding, and a war horse that he ""acquired."" He offers beds as well, and Cleos is tempted, but Brienne says they must ride on. So Jaime can ride, she strikes off his ankle chain at a smithy out back. The man tells them they will come to a burned village six miles downriver where they will come to a fork in the road. He says to avoid the south road that leads to Ser Warren's towerhouse, now in unknown hands with Ser Warren dead in the fighting, and strike south and east instead. They ride off into the night. When they reach the village, Brienne turns them south. Jaime is pleasantly surprised at her intelligence; it is clear that the man was trying to lead them straight to the outlaws.
They ride for awhile longer and then stop to rest. Brienne speaks harshly to Jaime for killing Aerys, and Jaime just says she does not understand. He then thinks back to the circumstances that led to his induction into the Kingsguard. When he and Cersei were twelve, Lord Tywin summoned Cersei to the Red Keep, hoping to eventually make a royal match for her. At about the same time, Jaime became squire to Ser Sumner Crakehall, a position he held for four years. He took part in the battle against the Kingswood Brotherhood and earned a knighthood for his actions. Stopping at King's Landing on his way back to Casterly Rock, Cersei informed him that Tywin was planning to wed him to Lysa Tully and that they only had one chance to be together. Ser Harlan Grandison of the Kingsguard had died in his sleep, and Jaime could replace him. She knew Tywin would not consent, but also realized that Aerys would not bother to ask. Once it was done, Tywin would not be able to openly object, as Aerys did not tolerate open dissent, having removed the tongue of Ilyn Payne merely for saying in public it was Tywin who really ruled the realm. Jaime hesitated at first, but Cersei won him over with a night of passion. The summons to join the Kingsguard came a month later, and while Tywin could not object openly, he was furious and resigned his position as Hand on a pretext, ironically separating Jaime and Cersei again when she was taken back to Casterly Rock. Brienne continues to press him, and he retorts by saying they are both kingslayers since Brienne killed Renly. Brienne denies the charge and says it was magic, which Jaime does not believe. She also says he soiled the gift of being a knight and a Kingsguard, causing Jaime to retort that he earned those honors, as he won a melee at thirteen as a squire and rode against the Kingswood Brotherhood and earned his knighthood on the battlefield from the hands of expedition leader Ser Arthur Dayne himself. That night, he dreams of the day he killed Aerys. He slipped into the throne room wearing his golden armor (rather than his Kingsguard white) and with blood on his sword. Aerys, hands covered in scabs because he was always cutting himself on the Iron Throne, asked if it was Tywin's blood, and Jaime responded it was the blood of Rossart, an alchemist currently serving as Hand because he shared Aerys's passion for fire, whom Jaime had just killed. Jaime then killed Aerys. Before he could leave the throne room, Ser Elys Westerling and Lord Roland Crakehall arrived, giving him no chance to vanish without being discovered. Lord Roland asked if they should proclaim a new king, and Jaime responded with indifference before sitting down on the throne to see who would come next. It was Eddard Stark.4 Brienne wakes him a few hours later, and they continue to ride.","Tyrion surprises Varys by being in the eunuch's chambers when he arrives. He asks Varys if it is true that Grand Maester Pycelle had been restored to the small council, and Varys says that he has. Tyrion is annoyed until Varys tells him that Tywin only did it after the Conclave met to choose his replacement. After the Conclave satisfied itself that ability counted more than birth by discussing Maester Turquin the cordwainer's son and Maester Erreck the hedge knight's bastard, they were prepared to elect Maester Gormon, a Tyrell, to the position. It was all part of a power play because the maester's insist that only the Conclave may make or unmake a Grand Maester. Tyrion retorts that Maegor executed three of them, and Varys adds that Aegon II fed Grand Maester Gerardys to a dragon. Varys says that Ser Boros has been reinstated to the Kingsguard as well. Varys wonders if Tyrion is there about Ser Mandon because he knows Bronn has been asking around about him. Bronn has been unable to find out much about him other than that Lord Jon Arryn brought him from the Vale for Robert to name to the Kingsguard. Tyrion tells Varys he wants to arrange a meeting with Shae to speak to her one last time before sending her away. He feels he is being watched, and Varys confirms it. All three Kettleblacks report on him to Cersei, and she is even tempting Ser Osmund with sexual hints. Petyr has agents in all the brothels and will report on Tyrion if he goes near one. As for Tywin, he has Varys spying for him. He tells Varys to arrange the meeting in Tyrion's chambers, but Varys informs him that there are no passages in Maegor's Holdfast save for a single escape path that does not connect with any other tunnels. Tyrion tells him to bring Shae to his own room instead then at moonrise.
Tyrion reads from Beldecar's History of the Rhoynish Wars for a time and then has Podrick help him bathe before returning to Varys's chambers. He passes Ser Balon and Ser Loras on the way, who are guarding either end of the gate to Maegor's Holdfast. He stops to ask Loras why he joined the Kingsguard at just seventeen. Loras answers that Prince Aemon the Dragonknight joined the order at seventeen, but Tyrion presses him further. Loras adds that a third son need not wed to continue the line, and Tyrion asks of love. He answers that when the sun has set, no candle can replace it.1 When he arrives, Varys greets him dressed as a lady, and Shae waits by the bed wearing nothing. They have sex, and then Tyrion tries to send her away. Instead, she asks to attend the wedding feast. Symon, who has now been hired by Lady Tanda to sing for Lollys, has told her that there will be a dancing bear, wines from the Arbor, seventy-seven courses, and a pie filled with doves. Tyrion refuses to let her go, but does grant her leave to stay with him against his better judgment. Tyrion looks for the passages that must exist in the room, and Shae tells him that one is under the bed. It is extremely heavy, but there is a counterweight. Tyrion takes his leave and wakes Podrick to fetch Bronn. When the sellsword arrives, Tyrion orders him to find Symon before someone else does.","Arya and Hot Pie are picking vegetables out of a garden when they hear singing. Arya has Hot Pie go wake up Gendry and hide the horses while she hides in a nearby tree. One of the horses whinnies, and the singer hears them. He discusses with two others shooting arrows over the wall, and Arya comes out and gives herself up. Gendry and Hot Pie reveal themselves soon after. The singer introduces himself as Tom of Sevenstreams and his companions as Lemoncloak and Anguy. Hot Pie gives his name, but Arya calls herself Squab and Gendry goes by the Bull. The three men say they are king's men loyal to King Robert, but Arya thinks they are outlaws. Hot Pie blurts out that they are looking for Riverrun, and Tom suggests they go to a nearby inn run by a woman named Sharna first. He tells them there will be food, including whatever Arya just stole from Old Pate's garden, who is dead, and has Anguy quickly send an arrow near Arya's head for emphasis. They agree to go along.
They arrive at the inn, which is the Inn of the Kneeling Man. Sharna greets them gruffly when they arrive and calls Husband down to help fix dinner. They all get seated, and a boy brings out Ale.1 Husband goes out for provisions and comes back to inquire about the horses in the stable. Tom laments that they are better than the ones Husband lost. He explains that Sharna was up at Lambswold birthing Fern and that he could not take the guests on alone. He gave them directions to the outlaws so they could take the horses back, but they never showed.2 Tom gives Arya a piece of paper and says it is redeemable for three gold dragons when the war is over; he is using it to pay for their horses. Arya begins to protest as Gendry comes in to announce that riders are coming. Arya and Hot Pie panic, but Sharna tells them not to be afraid. Arya reaches for her sword, but Lem grabs her. Fearing being captured again, Arya hits him with her tankard, breaking his nose. He grabs her again as the riders enter the inn. An enormous Tyroshi with a green beard is first,3 followed by many others. Arya recognizes Harwin and calls out to him. Harwin does not recognize her at first, but then realizes who she is and announces she is Arya Stark of Winterfell.","Catelyn hears the dogs go crazy in the kennels and knows that Robb must have returned with Grey Wind. Edmure has shunned her since their one meeting, and she has mostly been left alone with Lord Hoster. One night, she heard a lot of angry shouting and saw a group of forty men led by Ser Perwyn and Martyn leave the castle after trampling a Stark banner, but Maester Vyman refuses to tell her what happened. Ser Desmond eventually comes for her and tells her that Robb awaits her in the Great Hall. When she arrives, most of Robb's bannermen are already attending him, including the Greatjon and the Smalljon, Lady Maege, Lord Jason, Lord Tytos, Ser Edmure, and Ser Brynden. Catelyn is surprised to see an unfamiliar group of people on the dais with Robb. Utherydes bangs his staff as she comes forward. She tells Robb that she freed Jaime for her girls. Lord Rickard lashes out at her angrily because he has been denied vengeance for his sons. The Greatjon tells him to go easy as it was only a mother's folly. Robb stops the bickering and gives Catelyn his forgiveness by saying he knows what it means to commit a folly for love, causing Rickard to storm out angrily. Robb says he must speak with her and his uncles alone and ends the court. Catelyn realizes that Grey Wind is not at Robb's side where he belongs.
As the nobles file out, Lady Maege and the Greatjon give their sympathy and understanding to Catelyn, while Galbart, Lord Jason, and Lord Jonos are cool, but polite. When the hall empties, all that remains are Robb, Edmure, Brynden, Catelyn, and the six strangers on the dais. Robb introduces them as Lady Sybell Westerling, wife of Lord Gawen, her brother, Ser Rolph Spicer, castellan of the Crag, and Lord Gawen's children, Ser Raynald, Eleyna, Rollam, his new squire, and Jeyne, his new wife. Catelyn is taken aback, but realizes that Robb has snared her by forgiving her for freeing Jaime out of love for her daughters; she cannot object now. The Westerlings take their leave. Catelyn mentions that the Westerlings are sworn to Lord Tywin, and Robb says that Lord Jason captured Lord Gawen at the Whispering Wood and is holding him at Seagard. He will be freed immediately. Catelyn also points out that Robb has now lost House Frey. Robb explains what happened. He took the Crag by storm, with the Greatjon and Black Walder leading scaling parties over the walls. Robb commanded a ram at the gate and took an arrow in the arm. The wound festered, and Jeyne had him moved to her own bed and looked after him. She was there when he learned that Theon had killed Bran and Rickon, and she comforted him. They wed the next day. Robb might have been able to reason with Ser Stevron, but Ser Ryman and Black Walder would have none of it and left. Olyvar wanted to stay on as his squire, but Ryman did not allow it. The Greatjon thought they should attack the Freys then and there, but Robb knew that would lead to disaster. Robb hopes that Lord Walder will accept a compromise of some sort, but Catelyn does not believe he will. Not only did Robb break his promise, but he married the daughter of a house with lesser standing. They are an old house, tracing their lineage back to the First Men, and another Jeyne was wife to King Maegor three hundred years ago, but Frey is more wealthy and more powerful. Catelyn asks why Grey Wind is not there, and Robb responds that Jeyne is uneasy around him, and he growls around Ser Rolph. Catelyn says he should send Ser Rolph away on some pretext. She firmly believes that the direwolves were sent by the old gods as protectors. Robb used to think so until he learned what Theon did to Bran and Rickon.
They retire to Lord Hoster's audience chamber. Edmure continues to talk of his victory at Stone Mill until Brynden angrily cuts him off. Robb had wanted Tywin to come west. He had meant to lead Tywin's army, composed mostly of foot, on a chase though the Westerlands and then meet him on ground of his own choosing. If Tywin fought, he would have been bloodied. If not, he would have been trapped in the west while Stannis attacked King's Landing. If Stannis had won, Robb might have been able to forge a peace. Instead, riders from Bitterbridge were able to meet with Tywin just in time for him to link up with Lord Mathis and Lord Randyll and then march to meet Lord Mace and take Stannis in the rear. Catelyn says that Robb must now win back the North. Robb does not see how he can unless he wins back Lord Walder.","Jon, Ghost, and Tormund watch the giants ride by on their mammoths. Jon loses count at fifty and figures there must be hundreds. Tormund hails one of the giants, an older, graying one. He is Mag Mar Tun Doh Weg, Mag the Mighty, their leader. As they ride back to Tormund's band, the talk turns to Ygritte. Tormund asks why he will not take the girl, since she obviously is interested. She and Longspear Ryk joined Tormund's band after Jon was assigned there by Mance, and she always beds down next to him. Jon says he will not father a bastard, and Tormund does not understand. Jon thinks how different the wildlings really are. He likes Tormund well enough, but many of the others frighten him. Rattleshirt and the Weeper would as soon slit your throat as look at you, Harma Dogshead hates dogs and kills one every fortnight to use its head on a pole for a banner, Styr is practically worshiped as a god by his people, Varamyr Sixskins is a warg that controls a snow bear, three wolves, and a shadowcat, and even more exotic peoples come from the far reaches of the north such as the men of the Frozen Shore who ride chariots of walrus bone, the ice-river clans of cannibals, the cave dwellers who dye their faces blue and green, and the Hornfoots, who walk on bare feet as hard as leather. Many of the latter have never seen the Wall and speak the Old Tongue rather than the Common Tongue, but Mance has forged them into a united people by winning each village and band over one at a time with words or songs or war. Ygritte rides to meet them as they return and asks Jon if he believes in giants now. She begins singing ""The Last of the Giants."" Tormund joins in, followed by Ryk, Tormund's sons Toregg and Dormund, and Tormund's daughter Munda. Soon, the whole band is singing. Suddenly, Orell, in eagle form, launches himself at Jon and tears at his face. He misses the eye, but Jon is badly hurt. Rattleshirt is there too, to bring Jon to Mance. Ygritte says she will go, too.
Jon and Ygritte arrive at the Fist of the First Men, where Jon sees dead horses around the base. It is worse up top, where the snow is pink and dead horses are everywhere. Mance is there with Styr, Jarl, Harma, and Varamyr. Mance is furious at Jon for his lies and threatens to allow Styr to cut his eye out if he does not tell how many were there. Jon tells him. Next, Mance wants to know who was in command. Jon refuses to tell at first, and Mance threatens to turn him over to Rattleshirt if he does not start talking. He considers trying to kill Mance, but Mance realizes what he is thinking. Reluctantly, he tells Mance that Lord Commander Mormont was in charge. Mance says that he knows now why they had not been attacked yet and tells Varamyr to look for the wights and Rattleshirt to double the patrols and make sure every man has torch and flint. He tells Styr and Jarl to ride at first light. Rattleshirt wants to kill Jon now, but Ygritte speaks up and says they are sleeping together. Mance asks if this is true, and Jon says yes. Mance orders both of them to ride with Styr and Jarl on the morrow. He feels that if they can beat Lord Commander Mormont back to the Wall, they have won. Rattleshirt threatens Ygritte, and Jon moves to defend her. Rattleshirt is ready to fight until he notices that Ghost has returned and is watching them. On the way back to camp, Ygritte tells him they must now make good her statement that they are sleeping together.","A seamstress takes Sansa's measurements for a new gown. She is surprised to learn that Cersei has ordered it made. Her days have been better since she has begun spending them with Margaery and her ladies. Lady Leonette has been instructing her on playing the high harp, Lady Janna gives her choice gossip, Meredyth is always ready with a funny story, and Lady Alysanne reminds her of Arya. She has become closest, however, to Megga, Alla, and Elinor, who are now constant companions with whom she does needlework, plays at tiles, and worships in the sept. Elinor is the leader by virtue of being a flowered woman, and she is also betrothed to Alyn Ambrose, a squire and son of Lord Arthur Ambrose who distinguished himself in the battle against Stannis. Sansa thinks all three are children though, with heads full of chivalry and no real knowledge of war or death. She spends some time with Margaery too, and grows fond of the idea of having her as a sister. She warns Margaery again how terrible Joffrey is, but Margaery is unconcerned with her brother on the Kingsguard to shelter her as Prince Aemon sheltered Naerys from their brother and her husband, Aegon IV. Sansa is not so sure and thinks that Loras may end up killing the king and starting a war between Tyrell and Lannister. Sansa tells Dontos about her pending betrothal to Willas and that she no longer needs his help to escape. Dontos is not happy about this at all and responds that the Tyrells love her no more than the Lannisters and only want her claim as heir to Winterfell. As the measuring continues, Sansa's thoughts return to her new gown and how she cannot wait to wear it.","Arya and Gendry are riding south with the outlaws, including Greenbeard, Tom, Lem, Anguy, Harwin, and Jack-Be-Lucky. Hot Pie decided to stay at the inn to make bread. Harwin has told Arya what happened to him and the others that Eddard sent to bring Gregor to justice.1 Gregor's raids had been a ruse to draw Eddard out where he could be killed or captured and exchanged for Tyrion, and Lord Tywin had a trap prepared. Tywin had not anticipated that Eddard would break his leg and Lord Beric come instead. They were ambushed as they crossed at Mummer's Ford and hit from all sides. Gregor killed Ser Raymun, while Ser Gladden and Lord Lothar perished as well. Alyn was able to restore order and extricate them, but only twenty men remained, and Lord Beric was seriously wounded by a lance to the chest. Thoros stayed with him and prayed all night, and the next morning he was stronger again.2 When they learned Robert and Eddard were both dead, Lord Beric announced that they would fight on in Robert's name to protect the people until the war was over or they were all dead. Soon, they began attracting more followers, mostly commoners. The group stops at a seemingly abandoned village one night, where the people are actually hiding in secret cellars. There, they learn that Jaime has escaped. The next day, Arya realizes they are not going to Riverrun, but that she is being brought before Lord Beric instead. She makes a break for it, but is soon caught by Harwin. She promises not to escape again, at least for the moment.","Sam is walking through the snow miserably, retreating from the Fist of the First Men. He wishes he had a horse, but there are few left and they are reserved for the wounded such as Black Bernarr, who stepped in a hole and broke his ankle three or four days ago. Lord Commander Mormont is leading the survivors from the Others attack back to the Wall. There were about fifty at the beginning, but some have succumbed to wounds, others have wandered off, and something has been picking off members of the rear guard from time to time. Sam is very cold and wants to stop, but knows he will die if he does. He volunteered to be a torchbearer, one of those forming a circle around the group, for the warmth, but Dolorous Edd pointed out that he had carried one earlier and lost it. He asks for mercy from any gods that will listen, prompting him to remember how Maslyn asked for mercy at the Fist right before he died. He finally trips over a root, cannot get back up, and decides to rest.
Sam thinks back to the attack. When he heard the horns, he woke to see Chett near him. He knew he had to get off birds saying they were attacked and asked Chett to help, but the steward ran off. He got a raven off to both Castle Black and the Shadow Tower as the men loosed a volley. He then drew his sword and went in search of others. Ser Mallador Locke passed at one point as well as some Shadow Tower men. He heard the commander of the Shadow Tower men, Blane, give the order to knock as a ranger exclaimed that hundreds of wights were approaching. The first volley had no effect, and the Lord Commander appeared to order them to use fire arrows. When he saw Sam, Mormont told him to return to the ravens in case he had more messages. As he waited, he wrote several messages based on what he heard. As the fire arrows were loosed, Dywen led a cheer, but they kept coming. At one point, he heard someone exclaim that one of the wights was a giant bear. He heard close quarters fighting as a Shadow Tower ranger walked towards him and collapsed in death.
Sam tries to stop thinking about what happened at the Fist, trying to think instead of his mother, or his sister Talla or Gilly from Craster's Keep. Grenn comes by and tries to get him up without success. He is joined by Small Paul, who says he will carry Sam. Sam does not want to move, and Grenn tells him to think of something else, like his ravens. This prompts Paul to ask if he can have one, but Sam says they are gone. He once again thinks back to the battle. The call went out to mount up, meaning the Fist was being abandoned. He opened the cages of the ravens, but they flew away without him attaching any of the messages he wrote. He then saw the wights coming, most of them wildlings, but a few wearing the blacks of the Night's Watch. He ran, coming upon some archers in another part of the camp. Ser Ottyn was there kneeling and staring until a horse kicked him in the face. Sam found a horse and formed up next to Edd with most of the survivors. Thoren prepared to send out the reserves, but the Lord Commander ordered him to call them back and prepare to break out. They formed a wedge and prepared to charge when the wight bear appeared. Thoren charged and had his head lopped off, and then they charged and managed to win free. When they were clear, another member of the Watch leapt at him and took his horse, and he lay weeping until Edd found him. Sam remembers little from after that. Dywen managed to save five packhorses, of which three remain, and the Lord Commander organized the walkers and riders and set men with torches to guard the flanks and rear.
Grenn, Paul, and Sam begin to fall behind and are soon alone. Out of the woods, an Other comes sat on an undead horse that had once belonged to a member of the Watch named Mawney. Paul attacks it, but the Other kills him. Sam clutches at his dagger in fear and then lunges blindly at the Other. He pulled his dragonglass dagger by mistake. It takes the Other in the throat and causes the entire creature to dissolve. The dagger is cold to the touch afterwards. Dawn breaks, and Grenn says if they follow quickly to the east they should be able to catch the Lord Commander and the others.","Lord Tywin enters the council chambers and takes his place. Also there are Cersei, Varys, Grand Maester Pycelle, Ser Kevan, Lord Mace, Lord Paxter, Lord Mathis, Lord Petyr, the High Septon, and Tyrion. Varys reports that Lord Randyll defeated Robett outside Duskendale. The northmen lost a thousand men, including Ser Helman. The survivors, led by Robett, are fleeing back towards Harrenhal, but Gregor is waiting to trap them. Robb has abandoned all his conquests in the Westerlands. Ser Daven is reforming the army defeated at Oxcross and is preparing to join Ser Forley at the Golden Tooth. They will descend on the Riverlands when Robb marches north. Lord Mace offers his assessment of Robb's situation, which Tyrion finds laughable since his entire reputation rests on one indecisive victory over Robert at Ashford during Robert's Rebellion that was largely won by Lord Randyll's van before the main force arrived. Lord Mace's only other battle command was the siege of Storm's End, which lasted a year without effect and ended when he meekly dipped his banners to Eddard Stark.
Ser Kevan reports that Lord Balon has declared himself King of the Isles and the North and offers an alliance in exchange for recognition of his control of the North. Mace and Paxter think this would be a fine arrangement, but Tywin does not weigh in either way. Tywin brings up the Vale, and Lord Petyr says he can handle it. He has bedded Lady Lysa many times before and believes he can wed her with his new title of Lord of Harrenhal and return the Vale to the fold without bloodshed. Tywin agrees; in fact, they had already arranged it before the meeting. Tyrion asks who will be master of coin and discovers that he is to be elevated to that position. Tywin says that he will restore Lord Robert to the title of Warden of the East if the plan succeeds. Lord Petyr will sail on the morrow on a Braavosi ship called the Merling King.
Lord Paxter returns to the Greyjoy alliance. Lord Tywin says they should do nothing at the moment and see if a better option presents itself. Tyrion senses that someone has made an offer and wonders who it is and what they are asking for.1 The discussion turns to wedding plans, and Pycelle reports that three hundred Dornishmen will be coming. Tywin explains that Prince Doran is coming to take his council seat,2 but Lord Mace is not happy. He has been feuding with the Martells since Willas was crippled. They next divide the rewards from the battle. Everyone gets something, but Lord Mace comes out best by securing the Florent lands for Ser Garlan, making him lord of Brightwater Keep. Lesser tracts were set aside for Lord Randyll, Lady Arwyn, Lord Leyton, and others not present, while Lord Paxter is granted thirty years remission on taxes for some of the best wine vintages of the Arbor. Varys reports on recent events. A kraken was sighted off the Fingers and sank an Ibbanese whaler, a new war is brewing between Tyrosh and Lys in which both cities hope to win Myr as an ally, and there are reports of a three-headed dragon in Qarth.3 Tywin asks if there is any sign of Tyrek yet, but there is not. Kevan reports that Ser Addam wants to know what to do with several goldcloak deserters that have returned. Tywin says to break their knees as a lesson. Tyrion thinks they should send most to the Wall, but Tywin feels that if the Starks and Greyjoys both claim the North then they should defend it.
When the session is over, Tywin asks Tyrion, Cersei, and Kevan to stay. Tyrion voices his distrust of Petyr, but Tywin will not hear of it. In fact, he has just informed Tywin of the Tyrell plot to spirit Sansa away to Highgarden.4 Tywin plans to forestall this through marriage, starting with Cersei. Cersei is adamantly against another marriage, but Tywin is firm. He plans to wed her to Willas. Cersei leaves in a fury. After she leaves, Tywin tells Tyrion that he will marry Sansa. Tyrion is not entirely happy, though the title of Lord Protector of Winterfell is appealing. He says it will not matter anyway once Robb has sons, and Tywin reveals that he married Jeyne. Tyrion is shocked for many reasons, including that his father does not seem mad.5 Tywin usually does not suffer disloyalty amongst his bannermen, and when he was a boy he had completely destroyed two powerful houses, the Reynes of Castamere and the Tarbecks of Tarbeck Hall, for defying him. As the meeting ends, Tywin repeats that Tyrion must wed Sansa soon.","Catelyn stands to Robb's left as the bodies are brought in. Edmure stands to his right. All the bannermen are there, including Ser Raynald and Ser Rolph, but not the queen. The bodies are Tion Frey and Willem Lannister. Robb orders the Smalljon to have his father bring in the prisoners. The Greatjon leads in five men, two more died in the taking and an eighth is mortally wounded. The prisoners killed two guards as well, Delp and Elwood. Their leader is Lord Rickard. Robb confronts him angrily, and Lord Rickard mocks his king. He is angered that Robb did nothing to Catelyn for freeing Jaime. Ser Brynden comes in. Robb tells the Greatjon to hang the other seven, even the dead ones, and keep Lord Rickard until he is done conferring privately with Brynden. He adjourns with Brynden, Edmure, and Catelyn. Brynden tells him that the Karstark men, three hundred horse, are all gone; they snuck away in twos and threes during the night. Lord Rickard has offered his daughter's1 hand in marriage to any man who brings him Jaime's head. Edmure says they must keep the murders a secret, but it is too late for that. Robb says he must execute Lord Rickard as a traitor. The next morning, Lord Rickard is brought to the godswood. Robb takes the axe from Long Lew and does the deed himself. Before he dies, Lord Rickard says Robb will be accursed as a kinslayer, as House Karstark was founded a thousand years ago by Karlon Stark, who was granted lands after helping put down a rebel lord and built Karl's Hold, now known as Karhold. Catelyn retreats to Lord Hoster's solar afterwards to be with her father. Maester Vyman tells her it will not be long now. Jeyne comes in later. She does not know how to comfort Robb. Catelyn tells her to wait patiently and be there when Robb needs her, which he always will eventually. Catelyn tells her she must make an heir soon. Jeyne agrees and says that Lady Sybell gives her a concoction of herbs, milk, and ale every morning to make her fertile.2 She thinks she will be with child soon.","Brienne, Jaime, and Cleos arrive at Maidenpool. The castle still flies the standard of House Mooton, but much of the town is destroyed. They turn towards Duskendale. A little ways along the road, they are ambushed by archers. Cleos is hit and gets dragged along the ground by his horse. Jaime charges the archers followed by Brienne, and they run away. Jaime and Brienne find Cleos dead; he has an arrow in his arm and another in his chest, but it was having his head banged against the ground that killed him. Jaime asked to be released and armed with Cleos's sword, but Brienne refuses. He finally gets fed up, pulls Cleos's sword, and lunges at Brienne. They fight for a good while, but Brienne finally gets the better of him. She is trying to make him yield when they are surrounded by riders. It is a band of the Brave Companions, including Rorge and Timeon. Urswyck is in command. He informs Jaime that Vargo has been promised Harrenhal and fights for the Starks now. Jaime tells him that Brienne is worth a good ransom to spare her from rapes. They are taken to Vargo, who is at a pillaged sept. He tells Jaime that he means to send a message. Shagwell knocks him to the ground and a Dothraki1 cuts off his right hand.","Arya, Gendry, Greenbeard, Tom, Anguy, Lem, Harwin, Jack-Be-Lucky and the rest of the outlaws are at a half-ruined keep trying to track down Lord Beric. The old man1 there keeps going on about how he held Ser Maynard at the bridge. His maester2 tells them that Beric has been hanged. Lem says that this is true, but Thoros cut him down in time.3 Three days later, they stop at a village hidden in the trees run by a woman called the Lady of the Leaves. She tells them that Beric is dead as well, killed when Gregor stabbed him through the eye.3 Lem tells her that is an old tale and false. The next day they stop at the ruins of a village called Sallydance. The septon there tells them that Northmen came through and looted the sept while looking for Jaime. They stay there that night and the next day come to a place called High Heart. The hill is surrounded by the stumps of thirty-one weirwoods. Tom explains that the place was sacred to the children of the forest. The locals claim it is haunted by the spirits of the children that were killed there by the Andal king Erreg the Kinslayer.
That night, a storm wakes Arya, and she sees Greenbeard, Tom, and Lem talking to a shrunken old woman.4 She is telling them that the old gods will not let her sleep and send her dreams. She has dreamed of a shadow with a burning heart butchering a stag,5 a man without a face waiting on a bridge with a drowned crow with seaweed in its wings on his shoulder,6 and a woman who was a fish with red tears on her cheeks who is dead, but her eyes open.7 She asks Tom for a song in return. The next morning, Arya asks Tom about her, and he says she is just an old dwarf woman, but she did point them in the right direction to find Beric. The next day, they come to Acorn Hall. Lady Ravella Smallwood greets them on their arrival. When she learns that Arya is noble born, she has her bathed and clothed with her daughter, Carellen's, garments. Carellen is currently in Oldtown staying with a great-great-aunt who is a septa. Lady Ravella informs them that Lord Beric stayed there a fortnight past and tells them where to look for him. She also tells them that Northmen came looking for Jaime. They tell Arya to leave while they talk of these things, and she and Gendry go to check out the forge. They talk, and then start to wrestle. When they return to the castle, Ravella gives Arya another bath. The next morning, they ride off.","Daenerys stands in the Plaza of Pride in Astapor. The slavemaster Kraznys mo Nakloz is showing off his Unsullied. Daenerys is pretending she cannot speak Valyrian, so a ten-year-old slave girl from Naath1 is translating his words into the Common Tongue of Westeros. Arstan is with her as well, though he was against coming. Kraznys explains the training and discipline of the Unsullied, and Daenerys says she will consider his offer. She returns to Balerion with Aggo and Jhogo guarding her. On the way back, Arstan voices his strong disapproval of using Unsullied. Belwas is eating at the base of the ship when they arrive, and Ser Jorah waits for her on deck. Daenerys, furious that she must buy a slave army when she thinks their upbringing is horrible, slaps the knight, causing all eyes, including those of Groleo and Jhiqui, to focus on her. She goes below decks, where Irri is looking after Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion. Irri tells her that the dragons have been restless and do not like being caged; Drogon even bit her. Daenerys apologizes and sends her away to be alone. Ser Jorah comes after awhile. He tells her that while Unsullied may live harsh lives, they will not sack cities or rape women or kill babies when they have conquered. Daenerys wants to be honorable like Rhaegar, but Jorah points out that Rhaegar lived honorably and also died honorably, losing his kingdom.","Bran, Hodor, Meera, Jojen, and Summer make their way through the mountains towards the Wall. Bran laments that they would make better time on the kingsroad, but Jojen says it would not be safe. They see no people on their trek, save for one night when they shared a cave with a Liddle to wait out a storm. The next day as they are walking the talk turns to stories, and Bran asks if the Reeds know any. Meera mentions the Knight of the Laughing Tree. She begins the story of a young and inquisitive crannogman1 who wanted to see the world and left the swamps for the Isle of Faces. He stayed there all winter, and when spring broke crossed the river to Harrenhal. A great tournament was about to begin, and most of the finest knights of the land were in attendance. The king was there,2 as were the White Swords,3 who welcomed a new brother.4 The storm lord5 was there and the rose lord,6 while the great lion of the rock7 was absent due to a quarrel with the king.2 The daughter of the castle reigned as the queen of love and beauty, and her four brothers and her uncle of the Kingsguard were there to defend her.8 The dragon prince9 and his wife10 were there as well. The crannogman1 was accosted by three squires who beat him until the she-wolf drove them off.11 She took him back to her tent, where her pack brothers, the wild wolf,12 the quiet wolf,13 and the pup14 were staying as well. She convinced him to attend the feast that night, and he ate and drank with the wolves and their sworn swords, including barrowtown men, moose, bears, and mermen.15 At the feast, the dragon prince9 sang a song that made the she-wolf11 weep, while the storm lord5 won a drinking contest with the knight of skulls and kisses.16 A maid with laughing purple eyes17 danced with a white sword,18 a red snake,19 the lord of griffins,20 and finally the quiet wolf13 after the wild wolf12 said a word on his behalf. The crannogman1 recognized the squires who accosted him. They served a pitchfork knight,21 a porcupine knight,22 and a knight of two towers.23 The she-wolf11 pointed them out to her brothers and the pup14 offered the crannogman1 a horse and armor. Though he wanted to avenge his honor, the crannogman1 realized he was too small. He shared a tent with the quiet wolf13 that night, but prayed to the old gods first. The champions were all defeated on the first day, and the pitchfork,21 porcupine,22 and two towers23 were among the victors. At the end of the second day, a mystery knight entered the lists. Mystery knights are not unknown in Westeros, with more notable examples including Ser Barristan Selmy entering two tournaments as a youth, one of them when he was ten, and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight entering a tournament as the Knight of Tears so he could name Queen Naerys queen of love and beauty. This particular mystery knight was small of stature and clad in ill fitting armor, and the knight's device was a weirwood with a laughing red face.24 The knight challenged the pitchfork,21 porcupine,22 and two towers23 knights, and defeated each in turn. When they came to ransom their armor, the knight only told them to teach their squires honor. That night, the storm lord5 and the knight of skulls and kisses16 both swore they would unmask the Knight of the Laughing Tree.24 The next day, however, the knight failed to appear. The king2 sent the dragon prince9 to find the knight, but all he found was the shield.24 Bran likes the story, but wishes the she-wolf11 had been named queen of love and beauty. Meera says that she was, but that is a sadder story.25","Davos is in a cell beneath Dragonstone. When he first arrived, he was gravely ill, but Maester Pylos came to tend to him, and he is now much stronger. He is tended by two gaolers, one who brings his morning meal and another who brings the evening meal. They will not give their names, so Davos has named them Lamprey and Porridge. Melisandre comes to see him. Davos tells her that he wants no part of her since the horror she birthed at Storm's End; he says it was a creature of darkness. Melisandre counters that shadows are created by light, but states that Stannis's life force is too weak for her to make more shadows. She asks Davos if he will embrace R'hllor, and he responds that he wants nothing to do with the god. She explains that all is black and white, ice and fire, good and evil, and that a war has been raging since the dawn of time between R'hllor, the Lord of Light, the Heart of Fire, the God of Flame and Shadow, and the Great Other whose name may not be spoken, the Lord of Darkness, the Soul of Ice, the God of Night and Terror. All men must choose where to stand in this war, and Melisandre asks Davos where he stands. Davos replies that he is not sure and Melisandre tells him it is good he told the truth, for she would have known if he lied. Davos asks how he was caught, and Melisandre replies that she saw his purpose in her flames. She states that Stannis is R'hllor's chosen champion and that she has seen him in the flames leading the fight against the dark. She also quotes prophesy which states that ""When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to raise dragons out of stone."" She believes Dragonstone to be the place of smoke and salt.1 Melisandre leaves Davos to ponder what she has told him.
Roughly three days later, Ser Axell brings a new prisoner to join him, Lord Alester Florent. Davos asks him if there is any word of survivors from Fury since Alester's nephew, Ser Imry, commanded the ship, and Alester says it went down with all hands including Ser Imry and Davos's son Maric. He says the war is hopeless and most of Stannis's lords are gone. Lord Ardrian was captured and swore fealty to the Iron Throne, Lord Monford died on the Blackwater, Lord Guncer was burned by Melisandre, and Lord Duram is a fat, feeble boy of fifteen. Lord Alester explains that he penned a letter for Lord Tywin offering that Stannis give up his claim to the throne, renounce his claim about Joffrey's parentage, and wed Shireen to Tommen in exchange for being confirmed as lord of Dragonstone and Storm's End. Lord Alester would have done the same for Brightwater Keep. Since Stannis has been closeted with Melisandre and speaking to no one and Lord Alester had access to the king's seal, he prepared to send the letter without permission. He mentions talk of a stone dragon and mentions failed attempts to raise a dragon such as Aerion Brightfire, the nine mages, the alchemists, and Summerhall.2 Alester begins to weep.","Jon goes to speak with Ghost. He tells the direwolf that he is going over the Wall tomorrow and that Ghost cannot come with him. Jon tells him to make for Castle Black and hopes the arrival will serve as a warning. Ghost bounds off, but Jon has no idea whether he is actually making for Castle Black or not. He has been traveling south with Styr and Jarl for days. He and Ygritte sleep together every night and have now had sex on many occasions. A man comes to take him to Styr. Jarl is there as well. Styr asks for information about Night's Watch patrols, and Jon explains that they consist of two rangers and two builders who look for damage along the walk as well as for foes. Most patrols ride atop the Wall on mules, but one in four walks along the base to look for tunneling. This is because of Arson Iceaxe, a wildling raider that had been halfway through the Wall when discovered. Rather than stop him, the Watch just sealed the Wall behind him, leaving him trapped. Under Lord Commander Qorgyle, patrols went out every second day to the Shadow Tower and every third day to Eastwatch, but Qorgyle had more men and the time of the patrols also now varies on the advice of Benjen Stark. Styr also asks for numbers, and Jon over-states the strength of the Watch. Styr thinks he is lying, but decides it does not matter.
Jon goes off to look for Ygritte, and Grigg the Goat tells him she went deeper into the cave. He finally finds her in a chamber at the end of a small passage. She tells him that the tunnel goes on a long ways and that there are many such passages in the mountains, such as Gorne's way that goes under the Wall. Three thousand years ago, Gorne and his brother, Gendel, led the wildlings through the tunnels past the Wall, but were attacked by Starks out of Winterfell. Gorne killed the King in the North, but the king's son killed him and the sounds of battle alerted the Night's Watch, which took Gendel in the rear, killing him as well. The wildlings believe that Gendel actually escaped back into the tunnels but that he got lost and kept going deeper and deeper into the earth, where his descendants are still searching for a way out to this day. Ygritte takes her clothes off so that Jon can see her for the first time, and he gives her oral sex. The act is new to Ygritte, and she wonders who taught him. When Jon says he has had no one else, Ygritte teases him. She was not a maid, having sex with a boy five years ago. He tried to steal her, but Ryk chased him off. Jon is relieved that it was not Ryk she lay with, and Ygritte says that wildlings do not have intercourse with members of their own clan. Jon points out that Craster has married his daughters, and Ygritte scoffs that he is not really a wildling because his father was a man of the Night's Watch who stole a woman from Whitetree, but left her behind after sleeping with her. The woman tried to bring their son to Castle Black, but she was run off. When they are finally done, Ygritte says they should just stay in the cave and that she never wants to leave.","Daenerys stands before eight slave masters, including Kraznys and several named Grazdan, named for the founder of Old Ghis, Grazdan the Great, flanked by Irri, Jhiqui, Arstan, Belwas, Aggo, Jhogo, Rakharo, and Ser Jorah. She tells them she wants to buy all the Unsullied they have. The slave girl translates. The slavers are taken aback and ask for clarification. She states she would like all of the eight thousand available, plus the additional six hundred trained Unsullied in the city and the boys still in training. They balk at selling the trainees until she states she will pay double for all of them. One of the Grazdan's, who knows a few words of the common tongue, tells her that at double the price she only has enough gold from her trading goods for five hundred. She offers her ships as well, and the slavers say that will net her two thousand. She offers them a dragon. Arstan protests fiercely until Daenerys has Ser Jorah remove him. The masters agree to give Daenerys all she wants in exchange for the trading goods, ships, and Drogon. They include the slave girl in the deal as a token to serve as translator. Daenerys takes her leave with her retinue and the slave girl. She scolds Arstan for disagreeing with her in front of others, and then asks the slave girl her name, which is Missandei. Daenerys frees her and then quizzes her about the Unsullied. When they return to the ship, she feeds her dragons and then argues with Groleo over selling the ships. That night, she cannot sleep and goes on deck. After a brief talk with Ser Jorah, she is able to go to sleep. She wakes up from a dream and realizes someone is in her cabin with her. She hears Quaithe repeat her prophecy about going to Asshai,1 but when she gets out of bed, there is no one there.
The next morning, Daenerys rides Silver into Astapor with Aggo going before, Belwas and Missandei flanking her, and Ser Jorah to the rear. Jhogo and Rakharo guard her litter, in which Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion ride with Irri and Jhiqui. The rest of her people follow, including Groleo and his sailors, Arstan, and the eighty-three Dothraki that still remain with her. The masters await with the Unsullied in the Plaza of Punishment before the main gate of the city. Kraznys takes Drogon's leash and hands Daenerys the harpy's fingers, a nine lashed whip that symbolizes her ownership. Daenerys rides down the line of Unsullied and tells them in Valyrian that the deal is done and they are hers now. She then returns to Kraznys, who is having difficulty with Drogon. Daenerys tells the slaver that a dragon is no slave before tearing his face with the whip and ordering Drogon to unleash his fire. Drogon burns Kraznys to death. The other dragons join in, while Aggo, Jhogo, Rakharo, and Belwas begin attacking those few nearby soldiers that have not already fled. Grazdan mo Ullhor orders the Unsullied to defend him, but they do not move as Aggo kills him with an arrow through the mouth. They stir at Daenerys's command and begin killing the slavers and setting the slaves free.","Sansa puts on her new gown as Cersei looks on. When she is dressed, a maiden cloak is brought out for her, and Cersei informs her that she is to marry Tyrion. Sansa is in a state of shock and tries to refuse, but Cersei says that she has no choice. Ser Osmund and Ser Meryn wait outside to escort her to the sept. Joffrey waits for her at the steps of the sept and taunts her until Tyrion comes out and asks for a moment alone with her. Tyrion apologizes for the situation and says she may marry Lancel if she prefers, but Sansa, resigned to her fate, says they should continue. Inside the sept, the guests include Ser Balon, Ser Boros, Varys, Ser Addam, Dontos, Lord Philip, Ser Bronn, Jalabhar Xho, Lord Gyles, Lady Tanda, and Lollys, but not one Tyrell. Joffrey unfastens Sansa's maiden cloak, and then it is Tyrion's turn to fasten a Lannister cloak around her shoulders. He is too short and there is no stool, so Tyrion tugs on Sansa's skirt for her to kneel. She refuses, causing the assembled to laugh. Joffrey finally has Dontos bend down for Tyrion to stand on.
The Tyrells are at the wedding feast afterwards, including Margaery, Olenna, supported between Erryk and Arryk, Elinor, Alla, and Megga. Other guests include Alyn, Tommen, Lady Taena, Lord Mace, Lady Alerie, Ser Kevan, Lady Janna, Lady Meredyth, Lord Paxter, Lord Mathis, and Lord Tywin. Moon Boy and Dontos entertain. Ser Garlan comes up to Sansa and requests a dance, which Tyrion consents to. Ser Garlan is kind and tells her that Tyrion may be a bigger man than he seems. She dances with Lord Mace, Lord Orton Merryweather, Tommen, Ser Kevan, Jalabhar Xho, and Lord Paxter before ending up partnered with Joffrey. Joffrey tells her that he will have her whenever he wants because he is the king. She continues the dance with Lord Mathis, Ser Tallad, and Alyn before ending up back with Ser Garlan. When the dance ends, Joffrey announces it is time for the bedding. Tyrion says they will dispense with the bedding and threatens to geld Joffrey when he insists. Lord Tywin says they can do without the bedding and that Tyrion must not have meant to threaten the royal person. They walk to the bedchamber, where Tyrion pours some wine and tells Sansa to undress. He tries to talk to her and comfort her, but she does not respond to him. Finally, he has her get on the bed, but then decides that he cannot go through with it and will not touch her unless and until she wants him to.","Arya, Gendry, Greenbeard, Harwin, Tom, Lem, Anguy, Jack-Be-Lucky, and the rest of the outlaws arrive at Stoney Sept. Harwin tells Arya that one of the major battles of Robert's Rebellion was fought at Stoney Sept and named the Battle of the Bells. Lord Jon Connington took the town of Stoney Sept with a large host and then began searching for Robert house by house. While he was doing so, Lords Eddard and Hoster fell upon Lord Jon with their own force, and fighting raged throughout the town. The septons rang all the bells in the town to warn the people to stay indoors, which gave the battle its name. When Robert heard the bells, he joined the fight as well and personally slew Ser Myles Mooton. Lord Jon wounded Lord Hoster and killed Ser Denys Arryn, but was forced to withdraw in defeat. The town has obviously seen fighting, but is still inhabited and defended. The captain on the gate tells them that the Huntsman is off looking for Jaime. The Huntsman hates Lannisters because they raped his wife and sister, torched his crops, and killed all his sheep along with six of his dogs. In the central square of the town, they see eight men in crow's cages, only three of which are still alive. They are northmen who were looking for Jaime and did rape and murder at Tumbler's Falls. The Huntsman ordered them placed in the cages. Ser Wilbert, master of the town, is dead and his sons are off with Robb, so the Mad Huntsman is the defacto ruler of the town. Arya gives the men some water, despite warnings from the townsfolk that the Huntsman will not be happy, and then Anguy ends their suffering with a few well-placed arrows.
They ride to a partially damaged inn, the Peach, where they are greeted by the innkeeper, Tansy. She gets them baths and food, and girls as well, for it is a brothel. Alyce, Bella, Cass, Helly, Jyzene, Lanna, and Leslyn circulate around the establishment to pleasure the men. Arya and Gendry sit together. Bella approaches them and says she may be a bastard of King Robert. He had sex with all the whores at the Peach during the Battle of the Bells including her mother, and Lanna has told her that he liked Bella's mom the best. She is named Bella in honor of the Battle of the Bells. She asks Gendry if he wants to have her, but he angrily stalks off.1 An older man takes an interest in Arya, but Gendry comes back to scare him off before rounding on Arya in a surprising fury about their difference in status and stalking off again. That night, Arya dreams she is Nymeria hunting in the forest. The next morning, she is awakened by the sound of dogs barking. The Huntsman has returned with a captive, and Arya is delighted to see who it is.2","Jarl and eleven picked raiders prepare to climb the Wall in three teams of four. Mance has promised a new sword to each member of the first group to make it to the top. Jon and Ygritte watch their progress from below. Jarl leads the center team and gets a head start using a sentinel tree, while Grigg the Goat leads the team on the right and Errok the team on the left. Styr complains at how slow their progress is. Jarl retains the lead until around noon when his team hits a patch of bad ice, causing a delay. They eventually retake the lead again until the whole section of the Wall they are climbing gives way, and they plummet to earth. Jarl and two of the climbers are killed by the fall, the other is paralyzed and put out of his misery by one of Styr's men. Grigg reaches the top, followed eventually by Errok. They send down long lengths of rope to which ladders are soon affixed. It is a long hard climb, though only two of Styr's men are killed in the ascent. When Jon and Ygritte get to the top, Ygritte says she wishes they had found the Horn of Winter. This is what Mance had been looking for in the Frostfangs, opening many graves and releasing wights in the process. Ygritte says that if they had found it, they could have brought the whole Wall down.","Jaime's life has been agony since the Brave Companions took his hand. He has been forced to ride strapped to Brienne since he cannot sit a horse. He wears his hand on a cord around his neck, which Urswyck provided. One night, he tried to escape by taking a sword from Timeon. Shagwell just danced around him as he tried to land blows until he tripped and Rorge took the blade away. Vargo warns him that if he tries to escape again there will be consequences. Jaime just wants to die, but Brienne tells him that is craven and that he must live to take revenge. He realizes that she is right and that he must survive. The days blur together as they ride. On one occasion, he learns their destination is Harrenhal and laughs because it is where he received his white cloak after which he was sent away by Aerys and not allowed to joust in the tournament there. Now he is coming back. One night, Shagwell, Rorge, and Zollo decide to rape Brienne. Jaime realizes that she will be seriously hurt or killed and cries out, saving her and earning himself a great deal of pain when Rorge kicks his stump. Jaime and Brienne are guarded for the rest of the trip to protect them. Jaime and Brienne are paraded through the gates of Harrenhal on foot. They are brought before Lord Roose and a group of Freys including Ser Danwell, Ser Aenys, and Ser Hosteen1. Brienne speaks of her oath and her mission, but the Freys are still angry at Robb and care nothing about Stark oaths. Lord Roose catches them up on the major recent happenings in the kingdom before ordering Jaime cared for. He is not happy about the attempted rape of Brienne or the cutting off of Jaime's hand. Roose places Brienne under his protection and has Amabel lead her to new quarters. Walton escorts Jaime to Qyburn. Qyburn tells Jaime that he will have to lose the whole arm, but Jaime warns that he will kill him if he removes more than just the mortified flesh around the wound. Qyburn tends to Jaime's wounds.","Tyrion, guarded by Bronn, inspects the riverfront so that he can begin to plan the rebuilding of the destroyed dock facilities and the reopening of the port. Ser Kevan was supposed to oversee the project, but he has been distraught ever since news of Martyn's death arrived, particularly since Willem is still captive and Lancel has a wound that refuses to heal. Tyrion is in a black mood due to his marriage. The whole castle seems to know that Sansa is still a maiden, while the girl herself hates him and is revolted by his appearance. Furthermore, Shae appears completely indifferent to the match, and Tyrion realizes that the whore never really loved him. The inspection done, Tyrion turns to his other reason for going out. Bronn leads him to a small wine sink in a poor part of town where Symon Silver Tongue is waiting. Tyrion suggests that he take a tour of the free cities, spending a year in each. Tyrion will pay his passage. Symon counters with a few lines from a song he has written about Tyrion and Shae and threatens to sing it to Tywin or Cersei. Tyrion says that silence could be more profitable, and Symon names his price. At Joffrey's wedding feast, there are to be seven singers competing for a silver lute: Galyeon of Cuy, Bethany Fair-Fingers, Aemon Costayne, Alaric of Eysen, Hamish the Harper, Collio Quaynis, and Orland of Oldtown. Symon wants to perform too. Tyrion promises to create an opening for him. When he rejoins Bronn, he orders the man to wait three days and then return to kill Symon.
When Tyrion returns to the castle, Podrick informs him that Lord Tywin would like to see him. When Tyrion arrives, Tywin is examining a Valyrian steel blade with Tobho Mott. The sword is a gift for Joffrey and has an ornate scabbard and dark red ripples on the blade.1 Tywin is extremely pleased, as House Lannister does not own a Valyrian steel blade. The Kings of the Rock had owned one called Brightroar, but King Tommen II lost it when he died during a foolish expedition to Valyria. Eight years ago, Tywin's brother, Gerion, traveled to Valyria in an attempt to recover the sword and has not been heard from since. Three times Tywin tried to buy a sword from an impoverished old house, but was rebuffed each time. Tyrion wonders where the Valyrian steel came from.2 Tobho explains that he was trying to make the whole blade crimson, but the steel would not take the color. There is also another sword, which is for Jaime.3 Tobho takes his leave, and Tywin asks Tyrion about the port. Tyrion describes the work that needs to be done and wonders where the money will come from. Tywin tells him to find the coin or he will be replaced. Tywin next turns the discussion to Sansa and tells Tyrion that he must take her maidenhead. Tyrion is indignant and refuses to speak of the subject and further asks why there is no talk of impending nuptials for Cersei. Tywin reveals that Lord Mace refused his offer to wed Cersei to Willas. Apparently, Lord Mace was amenable, but Lady Olenna berated him into refusing. Tywin tells Tyrion that they must act as if the offer was never made. Grand Maester Pycelle arrives. He has a bird from Bowen at Castle Black stating that contact has been lost with Lord Commander Mormont, and he is feared slain with his entire command. The letter begs all five kings in the realm to send men to the Wall. Tywin does not feel the matter is that important, but thinks the Watch could be useful if molded properly. Lord Tywin plans to send a message stating that if the Watch wants to see any men, they must elect Lord Janos as their new Lord Commander.","Sam listens to Gilly giving birth above him and Bannen dying next to him. The survivors of the Fist are now at Craster's Keep. Sam is trying to feed Bannen broth. Craster says he is as good as dead already, which angers Giant. Without a maester, many of the survivors are not doing well. Kedge had taken off Bannen's foot nine days ago, but the infection had already spread too far. Some in the hall are even worse. Fornio has been delirious for days, and Ser Byam Flint has a shoulder oozing pus. They had some medicines when they began the trip, but the man in charge of them, Brown Bernarr, died on the Fist, and they were abandoned in the chaos of the retreat. Hake had also known some herblore, but he is dead now too. The men are getting restless and angry over the lack of food from Craster. Clubfoot Karl and Garth of Oldtown have been grumbling that he must have a hidden larder somewhere. Some of the men are also angry at how he treats his wives, including Garth of Greenaway, Black Bernarr, and Alan of Rosby. Sam goes out for some air. He sees Ollo Lophand and Tim Stone tending to the few garrons remaining. Sam hears a ragged shout and goes to investigate. He comes upon an archery competition between Sweet Donnel and Ulmer. Ulmer wins. He was a member of the Kingswood Brotherhood and loves to tell stories about some of its more legendary members such as Simon Toyne, the Smiling Knight, Oswyn Longneck, Wenda the White Fawn, Fletcher Dick, and Big Belly Ben. When they see Sam, Donnel, Alan, and some of the others begin to mock him. Sam finds Grenn, who greets him as Slayer. Everyone is calling him that for killing the Other, but most are just mocking him with it. Dirk, Black Bernarr, Garth of Oldtown, Garth of Greenaway, Garth Greyfeather, and Rolley of Sisterton, among others, do not believe it happened, but Dywen and Dolorous Edd believed him and made him speak to Lord Commander Mormont. Mormont took the dragonglass dagger for himself and divided up the few dragonglass arrows between his best archers: Muttering Bill, Garth Greyfeather, Ronnel Harclay, Sweet Donnel, Alan, and Ulmer.
Lord Commander Mormont rides into the compound with Dywen and Ronnel, who is now acting first ranger. Lord Commander Mormont calls for Sam to join him. He laments how the Watch has forgotten its true purpose and does not know things it should such as the effects of dragonglass on the Others. Craster comes out of his hall and announces he has a son. He further tells the Lord Commander that it is past time his men left. He barely has enough food for himself and now has another mouth to feed. Sam says they could take the boy, causing Craster and Mormont to both become angry. Mormont sends him off to tend to Bannen, but the man is dead when he arrives. Dirk states angrily that Bannen died because he was not fed properly and blames Craster. Lord Commander Mormont presides over a service for him that evening, and the body is burned. Sam is horrified that the burning body smells like pork and runs off to retch. Edd comes up to him afterwards and informs him they are leaving at first light the next day. When Craster learns they are leaving, he decides to send them off with a small feast.
At the feast, Craster sits at the head of the table with Lord Jeor beside him. Sam finds a place between Grenn and Orphan Oss. Only two loaves of bread are available, making some of the men angry. Karl and Dirk challenge Craster about holding out despite Lord Commander Mormont's anger, and Garth of Greenaway, Garth of Oldtown, and Ollo soon join in. The Lord Commander is able to finally silence them, but an angry Craster tries to dismiss the men from his table and his keep. One of them calls him a bastard, which Karl seconds. Suddenly, Craster lunges at Karl, but Dirk grabs him and slits his throat. He then grabs one of Craster's wives and tells her to lead them to the food or die. Lord Commander Mormont tries to intervene, but Garth of Greenaway and Ollo block him, and then Dirk stabs him in the belly. Sam does not remember much of what happened next. Garth of Greenaway killed Garth of Oldtown, while Rolley fell out of the loft while trying to get at Craster's wives and broke his neck. Grenn had tried to rouse him and then left with Edd, Giant and a few of the others.1 Craster is sprawled on top of Ser Byam who is no longer making any sound and will be dead shortly if he is not already. Ollo rapes one of Craster's wives on a table while four black brothers are eating horsemeat.2 Sam just sits on the floor with Mormont's head in his lap. The Lord Commander tells him to return to the Wall and tell the others all that happened. He also gives his dying wish that Jorah join the Watch. Sam is terrified into inaction, but then Gilly appears between two more of Craster's wives, Dyah and Ferny. They tell him to take Gilly south. Sam says he cannot leave Mormont, but they point out that he has died while they were talking. He asks where he should go, and they just tell him to go someplace warm. They feel the cold rising and say Craster's sons will be there soon.","Harwin removes a hood from Arya's head while Lem does the same for Gendry. They are in a large cave inside a complex tunnel system. Greenbeard points out Thoros to Arya, who is talking to Tom. He is no longer fat and bald, but has droopy skin and shaggy gray hair. The Mad Huntsman brings Sandor forward. Thoros walks over to Sandor and explains that he is a false priest no more but a true servant of the Lord of Light. Sandor verbally spars with Thoros, Lem, Greenbeard, and Anguy, before Lord Beric himself approaches. Sandor mocks him as well and tells the assembled to get on with killing him. Thoros says they will do justice. He, Harwin, Jack-Be-Lucky, Greenbeard, Tom, and others begin a litany of names of people killed by the Lannisters during the war, including Lord Lothar Mallery, Ser Gladden Wylde, Alyn, Ser Raymun Darry, young Lord Darry,1 Ser Andrey Charlton and his squire Lucas Roote, Ser Ormond, Ser Dudley, the Bastard of Bracken, Lord Deddings and his wife, Jack's brothers Lister and Lennocks, and a large number of commoners from towns like Fieldstone, Mousedown Mill, Donnelwood, Mory, Lancewood, and Shermer's Grove. Sandor is furious, as he was not personally responsible for any of those deaths. He says they can kill him, but they should not call it justice. Arya comes forward then and tells how he murdered Mycah.2
Thoros and Beric confer briefly and then decree that Sandor will have a trial by battle before the Lord of Light. Beric's squire, Edric Dayne, helps him removes his breastplate, exposing his ribs and a lance wound that went right through him. Thoros brings Sandor his sword and orders Anguy, Dennet, and Kyle to shoot him if he tries to cut his way free. After a prayer to the Lord of Light, the combatants prepare themselves for the fight. Beric draws his sword across his hand, and the blade catches fire. During the fight, Sandor is set on fire, but he manages to kill Beric. Thoros takes the body away while a woman named Melly sees to Sandor's injuries. Arya snatches Greenbeard's dagger and moves to kill him, but cannot do it. Arya tells Sandor to go to hell, and Beric emerges to say that he already has.","Catelyn watches as Lord Hoster is prepared for his final send-off. He is placed in a boat flying his colors with his shield, hunting horn, and helm and surrounded by driftwood and kindling. Seven are chosen to push the boat into the river, to honor the seven faces of god. They are Robb, Lord Jonos, Lord Tytos, Lord Karyl, Lord Jason, Ser Marq, and Lord Walder Frey's steward for the past twelve years, Lame Lothar Frey, who has just arrived with a Frey contingent led by Walder Rivers, Lord Walder's eldest bastard. The symbolism of sending a cripple and a bastard as envoys is not lost on anybody, but Robb greeted them gracefully and quietly asked Ser Desmond to step aside so that Lothar could join the funeral detail. Ser Brynden, standing next to Catelyn, tells Lord Edmure it is time. Edmure launches a flaming arrow at the boat, but misses. He tries twice more before finally handing the bow to Brynden in frustration, who successfully sets the boat alight.
Brynden escorts Catelyn to Robb and Jeyne. Robb embraces her, then begins receiving condolences from his lords, including Lord Jason, the Greatjon, and Ser Rolph. Lothar comes up and asks for an audience that evening, which Robb grants. Robb tells Catelyn to walk with him. A lot of bad news has been coming in recently. Robb has learned of the defeat at Duskendale and also that Robett was captured soon after the battle. He plans to exchange Martyn for him. Now, Robb has to tell Catelyn that Sansa has been married to Tyrion. Catelyn says it is time to bend the knee to the Lannisters, but Robb says he will never make peace with those who killed his father. Catelyn takes her leave.
Hours later, Rollam comes to summon her to dinner and the audience with Lothar. Robb, Edmure, and Walder are there as well. After dinner, Lothar begins by reporting that Winterfell has burned. Big Walder and Little Walder have sent a letter stating that a battle was fought and Theon put the castle to the torch when hope was lost and most of the people to the sword.1 Most of the women and children survived and were taken by Ramsay to the Dreadfort. Lothar says that Walder will accept a new marriage alliance if Robb comes to the Twins and apologizes personally for his actions. Robb accepts. Lothar says that in that case, Edmure must marry Walder's youngest daughter, Roslin, the child of his sixth wife, Bethany Rosby. Edmure is furious that he must marry a woman he has never seen, but Walder says that their will be no alliance if these terms are not met. Robb dismisses the Freys. Edmure tries to refuse, but the others tell him winning back the Freys is essential, and he grudgingly relents.","Lamprey comes to Davos and Alester's cell with Ser Axell and four guardsmen. Alester thinks they must be there for him, but they have come for Davos. Axell tells him that Stannis has summoned him. They ascend to the surface and begin to cross a bridge to the Stone Drum. Halfway across, Ser Axell pulls him aside. He says he still believes Davos a traitor and would rather burn him and claims he can see visions in the flames and knows that Stannis will sit the Iron Throne. He wants to be Hand, and he wants Davos to tell Stannis that he should be Hand. Selyse supports him, and he has crafted a plan with Salladhor that he wants Davos to endorse. He says he will give Davos a ship to command if he helps, but threatens to kill Davos if he does not comply.
Davos is brought into Stannis's presence, who looks old and worn. He greets Davos and asks what the punishment for treason is. When Davos answers death, Stannis feels he must justify the punishment, saying it was laid down even before Aegon I conquered Westeros and has been administered to all traitors, Daemon Blackfyre, the Toyne brothers, the Vulture King, Grand Master Hareth, and even Rhaenyra Targaryen, daughter of one king1 and mother to two more2 who died a traitor trying to usurp her bother's crown.3 Davos realizes they are talking about Lord Alester. Davos says the man meant no treason, but Stannis will not hear of it. He also mentions how Robert had a gift for inspiring loyalty that Stannis lacks. At Summerhall, Robert won three battles during Robert's Rebellion against lords that meant to turn him over to Aerys II. He captured two of the leaders, Lord Cafferen and Lord Grandison, and rather than throw them in the dungeon managed to win them to his cause. Lord Cafferen died at the hands of Lord Randyll Tarly at Ashford, while Lord Grandison took a wound on the Trident and died of it a year later.
Stannis next asks Davos to comment on Axell's plan. He means to attack Claw Isle and leave it a desolate wasteland because Lord Ardrian swore fealty to Joffrey. Despite Axell's threats, Davos says the plan is folly and cowardly. He says that the men of Claw Isle fought for Stannis and burned on the Blackwater and that the raid would be repaying them by killing their women and children. Axell points out that hundreds of Lord Ardrian's men went over to Joffrey with him, and Davos counters that they had no choice but to follow their liege. Stannis says that it is every man's duty to stay loyal to his true king, and Davos points out that he betrayed Aerys. Stannis orders Axell to leave and summon Melisandre.
Stannis speaks of the throne. The Iron Throne is barbed and jagged and may cut the unwary. Aerys II cut himself so many times that he was called King Scab behind his back. Maegor was murdered on the throne, and some say the chair itself killed him. Stannis does not want to be king, but is the legitimate heir, and it is therefore his duty. He means to bring justice. Ser Barristan once told him that the rot in Aerys's reign began with Varys. He means to do justice upon Cersei, her children, Varys, Jaime, and others as well until the court is scoured clean. He feels Jaime should have been stripped of the cloak and sent to the Wall as Eddard had wanted, but Robert listened to Lord Jon instead and pardoned him.
Stannis asks why Davos wanted to kill Melisandre, and Davos explains how he believes she sent the fire that killed his sons. Stannis states he has wronged her and that she has always been his most faithful servant. Conversation turns to Edric. Stannis mentions that Melisandre told him that a king's blood has power. Stannis turns next to Westeros and says that Davos is right about Ser Axell's plan. He means to bring justice, and a raid on Claw Isle would only be revenge. He orders Davos to kneel, and names him Lord of the Rainwood, Admiral of the Narrow Sea, and Hand of the King. Davos is shocked and tries to refuse the honor, arguing that he cannot even read nor write. Stannis counters that of his great lords Ardrian has abandoned him, the new Lord Sunglass has fled to Volantis, and Duram Bar Emmon and Monterys Velaryon are only children. He does have a few good men left, including Ser Gilbert Farring who holds Storm's End with two hundred men, Lord Lester Morrigen, Rolland Storm the bastard of Nightsong, Lord Lucos Chyttering, and Ser Andrew Estermont, but Stannis trusts none of them like Davos and wants his council for the coming battle. Davos says they cannot win another battle with the Lannisters, but Melisandre enters and tells him it is the final battle against the Great Other that Stannis speaks of. Stannis tells Davos that he has seen it in the flames. Melisandre showed him a hill in a forest surrounded by a ring of torches with men in black moving on top of it and shapes coming towards them in the cold.4 Melisandre says the battle has begun. She has brought leeches with her on a silver platter. She says they will work, but they will also fail. She urges Stannis to give her Edric, as only royal blood can wake the stone dragon. Stannis refuses. Melisandre lifts the lid on the platter, revealing three leeches gorged on Edric's blood. Stannis throws each into a brazier one by one, saying the name of each usurper to the throne before tossing them in: Joffrey, Balon, and Robb.","Jaime comes to the bathhouse to bathe, as Lord Roose has invited him to dinner. Brienne is there as well. They verbally spar awhile, until Jaime apologizes and says he is sick of fighting; he wants a truce. Brienne counters that truces are based on trust. Jaime does not know why he does it; probably due to his injuries, but he tells the full story of the death of Aerys.
Lord Jon was exiled after losing the Battle of the Bells and replaced as Hand by Lord Qarlton Chelsted. Aerys finally realized that Robert was a serious threat. He reminded Prince Lewyn that he held Elia and sent him south to take command of ten thousand Dornishmen heading north. Ser Jon and Ser Barristan were sent to Stoney Sept to take command of the remnants of the army there. Prince Rhaegar returned from the south and told Aerys to summon Lord Tywin, but the ravens to Casterly Rock went unanswered. Aerys saw traitors everywhere, and Varys was always ready to point out any he missed. In his fear, Aerys commanded three leading alchemists, Rossart, Belis, and Garigus, to place caches of wildfire all over King's Landing. Lord Qarlton figured out what was happening and tried to dissuade Aerys through reason, jest, threats, and outright begging. When he failed, he threw down his chain of office, so Aerys had him burned alive and made Rossart, his favorite pyromancer and the one who roasted Lord Rickard alive, his new Hand. Jaime saw everything because he was the only member of the Kingsguard left in the city,1 for he was Tywin's son, and Aerys did not trust him to be away from his side. After Rhaegar's defeat at the Trident, Aerys sent Rhaella and Viserys to Dragonstone. Elia would have gone as well, but Aerys believed that Prince Lewyn must have betrayed Rhaegar and thought that the only hope of keeping Dorne loyal was to keep her and her children close to him. Aerys planned to burn the whole city with wildfire rather than let Robert have it. When Lord Tywin reached King's Landing, Pycelle convinced Aerys he was there to help, and Aerys opened the gates. When Tywin began to sack the city, Jaime was charged with holding the Red Keep, but knew that all was lost. He sent a messenger to ask for permission to make terms, but Aerys responded that he should bring him Tywin's head if he is not a traitor. The messenger also said that Rossart was present, and Jaime knew what he had to do. He slew Rossart, then Aerys. In the following days, he tracked down Belis and Garigus and killed them as well. Brienne asks why he never told that to anyone, and he says that the Kingsguard are sworn to keep the king's secrets, and Eddard would not have been interested in explanations anyway.
Jaime tries to get out of the bath, but gets dizzy and smashes his stump against the side of the tub. Brienne catches him before he can fall and has the guards fetch Qyburn. Qyburn tends to him, and then Brienne finishes cleaning him. Qyburn returns with clothes for both of them and a potion to strengthen Jaime. A half-hour later, Jaime is strong enough to stand, and supported by Brienne, he goes to dinner. Lord Roose waits in the center of the great hall, with only Elmar attending him. Roose explains the situation to them. He reports on Robb's marriage and Edmure's impending marriage. He also reports that Arya has been found, and he means to see her safely back north.2 Brienne continues to speak of her mission to see Jaime exchanged for Arya and Sansa, but Roose does not seem to care. He does, however, plan to send Jaime on to King's Landing, but he has a small problem. Vargo took Jaime's hand for a reason. Vargo knows that he is a doomed man now and wants to turn Jaime over to the Karstarks so he may wed Alys and gain sanctuary in the North. He did not have the strength to see him there by himself, however, and therefore had to bring him to Harrenhal. He took the hand so that Lord Roose would be implicated in the act and could not send him back to Tywin. Jaime promises to speak of how Lord Roose saved him, and the matter is settled. Roose then turns to Brienne and says it would be unconscionable to deprive Vargo of both his prizes. His guards take her away.","Tyrion awaits the arrival of Prince Doran's entourage. With him are Ser Addam and an escort of goldcloaks and a contingent from the court. Tyrion is not happy by the number of banners he sees. He turns to Bronn and asks how many there are, and Bronn answers there are nine. He then calls Podrick up to tell who the banners belong to; he has been studying Dornish heraldry at Tyrion's command. They are waving too much, so Bronn describes each in turn and Podrick identifies the house. They belong to Martell of Sunspear (red sun on orange with a spear through its back), Dalt of Lemonwood (purple field strewn with lemons), Blackmont of Blackmont (a vulture with a baby in its talons on a yellow field), Manwoody of Kingsgrave (a crowned skull on black), Qorgyle of Sandstone (three black scorpions on a red field), Uller of Hellholt (red and yellow separated by a jagged line), Allyrion of Godsgrace (a pie of red and black slices with a gold hand in the middle), Gargalen of Salt Shore (a cockatrice eating a snake), and Jordayne of the Tor (a golden quill on green checks). Tyrion is even more disquieted that these represent most of the greatest houses of Dorne. Podrick points out there is no litter; Prince Doran has gout and always travels in one. As they get closer, Tyrion spies their leader and knows who he is dealing with.
As the two groups meet, he greets them and feigns confusion as to which one is Doran. The leader says Doran's health requires he remain at Sunspear, and Tyrion greets Prince Oberyn Martell. Oberyn introduces his companions: Ser Dezial Dalt, Lord Tremond Gargalen, Lord Harmen Uller, his brother Ser Ulwyck, Ser Ryon Allyrion, his son Ser Daemon Sand, the Bastard of Godsgrace, Lord Dagos Manwoody, his brother Ser Myles, his sons Mors and Dickon, Ser Arron Qorgyle, Myria Jordayne, heir to the Tor, Lady Larra Blackmont, her daughter Jynessa, her son Perros, and Ellaria Sand, his own paramour. Tyrion introduces his own companions: Ser Flement, Lord Gyles, Ser Addam, Jalabhar Xho, Ser Harys, Ser Merlon Crakehall, Lord Philip, Bronn, and Podrick. He only knows Oberyn by reputation, but that reputation is truly formidable. When he was sixteen, Oberyn was found in bed with the paramour of Lord Edgar Yronwood, resulting in a duel between Oberyn and the older and much larger lord. Because of the Prince's youth and high birth, the duel was only to first blood and ended after both combatants took cuts. Lord Yronwood's wounds festered and killed him, however, and Oberyn has been known as the Red Viper ever since due to rumors that he fought the duel with a poisoned blade. He travelled extensively in the Free Cities, where he learned much about poisons and perhaps even darker arts. He studied at the Citadel, forging six links of a maester's chain before growing bored and later served as a soldier in the Disputed Lands, first as a member of the Second Sons and later as the captain of his own company. He has reputedly bedded men and women all over Dorne and fathered a large number of bastard daughters known as the sand snakes. He also crippled Willas Tyrell, heir to Highgarden, in a tournament. Tyrion realizes that the enmity between Oberyn and the Tyrells could lead to disaster at the wedding.
Oberyn and Tyrion talk as they ride. Oberyn speaks of the time they met years ago, right after Tyrion was born, when he visited the rock with his mother, her consort, and his sister Elia. Lady Joanna had died giving birth to Tyrion, and the castle was in mourning. It was said in those days that Lord Tywin, still Hand of the King at the time, ruled the Seven Kingdoms, but Lady Joanna ruled Tywin. Tyrion's uncles had often commented that her death greatly changed Tywin and that the best part of him died with her. Lord Tywin ignored his guests, but Cersei and Jaime had taken Oberyn and Elia to see him when they were at Casterly Rock discussing potential marriages. Cersei twisted his cock and made him scream until Jaime made her stop. Next they talk of whores and taxes. Tyrion, at his father's behest, has instituted a penny tax on whoring to help pay for the wedding. Oberyn quips that he should keep pennies around, as he and Ellaria want to have some fun with a blonde or two. Next Oberyn asks when the justice will be served. Tyrion says that there has not been time for inquiries, but Oberyn says that he already knows that Gregor is responsible. He means to kill the Mountain and find out who gave him his orders. Tyrion says his three hundred are no match for the thousands in the city, but Oberyn is not intimidated. Tyrion threatens him again and rides past him.","The Brotherhood ambushes a group of Brave Companions just before dawn. Anguy takes out a sentry on a roof, while Kyle and Notch take out two guards in front of a sept. One of the sentries screams when the torch he is carrying lights his clothes on fire, and the rest of the Brotherhood charges at Thoros's command. Arya and Gendry are watching from a nearby hill, guarded by Beardless Dick and Mudge. Flaming arrows set the sept alight, and soon the Companions start pouring out and the battle begins in earnest. Watty takes a wound and Kyle goes down before Lord Beric gives the signal and the rest of his men, including Lem and Edric, leave their hiding places and charge into the fray. Soon, it is all over; all the Companions are dead or prisoners save for two Dothraki that Lord Beric lets escape to carry word back to Harrenhal. Jack-Be-Lucky, Harwin, and Merrit enter the burning sept to search for captives and come out with eight brown brothers and a septon. The septon is Utt, the leader of this group of Brave Companions. After a brief trial, Utt and the other prisoners are all hanged one by one, with Tom playing a dirge through the proceedings. Arya wishes they had hung Sandor too, but they had treated his wounds, returned his sword, and let him go.
That night, they stay at the brewery, one of the few standing buildings left at this monastery that once held forty-four brothers. Lord Beric catches Arya looking at him and beckons her closer. She says she thought Sandor had killed him, and Lem speaks up to say it was a grievous wound, but Thoros is a gifted healer. Beric sends Lem away and says that even brave men blind themselves from truths they do not want to see. He asks Thoros how many times he has been brought back by the Lord of Light, and Thoros answers six, though each time is harder than the last, and Thoros does not think he can do it many more times. Gregor has killed him three times, including with a dirk in the eye, Ser Burton smashed his skull, and Ser Amory hanged him. He no longer remembers where his castle is located, to whom he is betrothed,1 who knighted him, his favorite foods, or many other basic things. The first time he came back to life, Thoros was giving him his last rights according to the faith of the Lord of Light and giving him the last kiss, breathing fire down his throat. It is a standard ritual, but never before has it brought a man back from the dead. The Lord of Light is not done with him.
Later, Gendry approaches Beric and says he would like to smith for the Brotherhood. Lord Beric reluctantly agrees after warning him of the dangers and knights him. Sandor appears and mocks the proceedings. Beric asks how he found them and got past the sentries, and Sandor says that there was enough smoke to track them from a long way off, and he may have killed the sentries. He has come for his gold, which Beric refuses to give back. He finally leaves. Harwin leaves to check on the sentries, while Beric orders Anguy to kill Sandor's horse if he follows the next day. Some of the men want to kill him, but Beric will not allow it, and Thoros points out that Sandor won his trial by combat when the Lord of Light snapped Beric's sword. The Lord of Light is not done with him yet either. Harwin comes back and reports that the sentry, Puddingfoot, is asleep but unharmed. The next morning, Likely Luke and Watty scout the area but find no sign of Sandor. The outlaws get underway.","Bran, Hodor, Meera, Jojen, and Summer approach an old, abandoned village on a lake with a tower on an island in the center. Summer spies three deer and takes off after them. They are out of the mountains, and the terrain consists of grasslands, fields, low rolling hills, and bogs all the way to the Wall. Jojen says they should stay there for the night as a storm is coming. No buildings are still intact save the tower, which appears unreachable. Bran says there is a hidden causeway to the tower. He recognizes the place as Queenscrown, where Queen Alysanne stayed on her visit north. She rode her dragon Silverwing to the Wall and was so impressed by the Night's Watch that she convinced her husband, Jaehaerys I, to double the size of the Gift, that land adjacent to the Wall controlled by the Night's Watch. The top of the tower is painted gold to honor the event. They find the causeway and make their way to the island. They get through the front door of the tower, but iron bars block access to the rest of the structure. Bran pulls down an iron grate over a murder hole, and they are able to climb through to the upper levels. Once they are settled, Bran asks Jojen how he means to get through the Wall. He says he means to go to one of the abandoned castle and try to find an opening. They see a lone rider heading towards the village and take cover in the tower as the first drops of rain begin to fall. Soon it is pouring, and thundering beside. Hodor gets scared and starts screaming. During one flash of lightning, Jojen spies men down below entering the village. Hodor will not stop screaming, and Bran reaches for him as he does for Summer and actually takes control of him for a second, frightening himself, but silencing Hodor. He then opens his third eye and becomes Summer, who is scouting the men warily in the rain. He can smell their fear.","Jon and Ygritte look out at a towerhouse in the distance. Ygritte is incredulous that men can build such structures. They begin to talk about differences in their cultures. Ygritte is disdainful of kings and those who kneel to them, and boldly states that Mance will teach them a lesson. Jon tells Ygritte that Mance has no chance of winning and that all the wildlings will die. Ygritte refuses to believe it and angrily reminds Jon he is one of them now too and kisses him fiercely. Jon kisses back, but sadly laments that she is a wildling to the core. He has been waiting for a chance to escape, but Styr still does not trust him and has him watched day and night. Every day, Styr summons him before himself, Grigg, and Errok to quiz him about Castle Black. He lies where he can, but realizes the truth is bleak. Only four hundred men remain at Castle Black, most of them stewards and builders. If Styr achieves surprise, which is likely under the circumstances, it will be a massacre. Everyday, it also becomes harder to think of betrayal. Despite his best efforts, he is beginning to become friends with some of the raiders, including Errok, Grigg, Quort, Bodger, Hempen Dan, Del, Henk the Helm, Toefinger, Big Boil, and Stone Thumbs. They travel until around sunset, when Lenn says a bad storm is on the way. Grigg tells Styr that there is a town within two or three miles, and he agrees to shelter there.
By the time they arrive, it is past dark and the storm is raging. Del reports that there was an old man staying in the ruined inn. Jon walks off to find a dry spot. Ygritte finds him later, and he tells her the village is Queenscrown. One of the Thenns comes and summons him to Styr; Ygritte comes too. Styr wants him to kill the old man that was captured. Jon cannot bring himself to do it despite Ygritte's urgings to prove himself. Styr mocks them as a crow and his wife, and Ygritte angrily stalks forward and slits the man's throat. Just then, Summer charges into their midst, quickly killing a Thenn and Del. Jon realizes he will never get a better chance and takes the old man's horse. Bodger tries to stop him, but Jon kills him. After that, he is able to break away. Hours later, he stops and realizes there is an arrow in his leg. With great effort, he pulls it out, washes the wound, and bandages it as best he can. He then turns north for Castle Black.","Daenerys, riding Silver, and Ser Jorah mount a ridge and look down upon the Yunkish army in their path. There are five thousand men. The Yunkish hold the center themselves while the flanks are held by two sellsword companies, the Second Sons and the Stormcrows, with about five hundred men each. Ser Jorah says they can defeat the army easily, but Daenerys is worried about the cost, as replacements for her army may be hard to come by. She orders him to extend an invitation to the slavers and the leaders of the sellsword companies to meet with her separately. She returns to camp, where the Unsullied are busy fortifying, and speaks to Grey Worm. He is the leader of the Unsullied, chosen by the acclamation of his peers when Daenerys told them to nominate officers. Ser Jorah is training him for command. Daenerys let the Unsullied choose their own names after freeing them, and many of them went back to their old names from before they were cut, but Grey Worm chose to keep the name he bore on the day Daenerys freed him because he considers it lucky. Daenerys rides on to her tent. Beyond the orderly camp of the Unsullied is a disorganized camp of tens of thousands, refugees from Astapor. Daenerys left the city in the charge of a council of former slaves led by a healer, a scholar, and a priest, but many of the slaves were afraid to stay and now follow her. They are weak and ill-trained and strip the country bare on the march, but Daenerys does not have the heart to abandon them.
Belwas and Arstan are waiting at her tent; they are guarding her on the march since she needs Aggo, Jhogo, and Rakharo to lead her few Dothraki outriders. Rhaegal, Viserion, Drogon, Irri, Jhiqui, and Missandei are inside. Missandei tells her that the slave masters of Yunkai call themselves the Wise Masters and will speak a dialect of Valyrian. An hour later, Ser Jorah returns with the captains of the Stormcrows. There are three of them who claim equal rank. They are Prendahl na Ghezn, Sallor the Bald, and Daario Naharis. Arstan, Belwas, and Grey Worm are with Daenerys in addition to Ser Jorah. She tries to get them to change sides, but they refuse and leave, though Daario gives her a polite nod on his way out. Two hours later, the commander of the Second Sons, Mero, the Titan's Bastard, arrives. He is interested in having sex with Daenerys, but not with changing sides or leaving the conflict. He does ask for some wine, and Daenerys allows him an entire wagonful, wine being at a surplus after the looting of the slave masters' stock in Astapor. The Yunkish envoys arrive at sunset, fifty men led by Grazdan mo Eraz. He comes with two chests bearing fifty thousand marks and promise of safe passage if she will leave Yunkai alone. Daenerys counters that she will give the Wise Masters of Yunkai three days to release all their slaves, at which point her Unsullied will inspect the city and depart if all the slaves have been released. Grazdan says the offer is insane, and Daenerys signals her dragons to breathe fire, singing Grazdan's clothes. She tells him to leave and summons Aggo, Jhogo, and Rakharo. She tells the assembled that they will attack an hour past midnight. The Unsullied will attack the flanks while the Dothraki charge the center in wedge formation. It takes an hour to hammer out the details, after which she retires.
Near midnight, Ser Jorah comes with Daario in tow. He comes to offer the Stormcrows to her cause and brings the heads of Prendahl and Sallor as proof of his sincerity. Daenerys accepts his oath of fealty and orders him to return to his camp and take the Yunkish host in the rear when the attack begins. He agrees and leaves. Ser Jorah says it was a mistake to trust him, and Daenerys becomes angry. She tells him she is sick of him trying to push every man away and make himself indispensable. She cherishes and trusts him, but will never love him. Ser Jorah departs stiffly. Daenerys is not able to sleep as the battle begins and summons Arstan to tell her more of Rhaegar. He tells her that he was proficient with the lance, but never enjoyed battle and rarely entered the lists. He preferred his harp, but there was always a sense of doom around him, perhaps owing to the circumstances of his birth. He was ""born in grief"" at Summerhall.1 He would often go there alone, without even the Kingsguard, and sleep in the ruined hall, always returning with a song. Daenerys hears horses, and Ser Jorah enters to announce victory. The Stormcrows turned, the slaves broke, and the Second Sons were too drunk to fight. Two hundred were killed and several thousand captured to only about a dozen losses. Grazdan had already left to deliver her terms to Yunkai, and Mero fled and has not been found. Daenerys orders all who yield to her spared and for the Second Sons to remain in existence if enough come over to her. The next day, she marches her army to Yunkai and waits. On the third day, the gates open and freed slaves begin pouring out. She has Missandei tell them to whom they owe their freedom as they walk by, and they begin to shout ""mother"" in many different languages. Soon she is being swarmed by freed slaves. She spurs Silver forward and rides among them as they touch her and call out to her.","Arya sees a hill in the distance and realizes they have returned to High Heart. They make camp on the hill. Arya, Gendry, and Edric watch as Thoros gazes into the fire. Edric says he sees things in the flames sometimes, but he sees nothing that day. Gendry states that his master, Tobho Mott, used to say Thoros was a sot and a fraud, and Thoros agrees that was once true. He was the youngest of eight, so he was packed off to the temple. He never took to the profession, often raiding the kitchens and sleeping with women. He was good with languages and occasionally saw things in the flames, however, so he was kept around. He was finally sent to Westeros because he was such a hassle and it was hoped Aerys II, with his love of fire, could be converted. Aerys never took to him, but Robert did from the moment he used a flaming sword in his first tournament melee and Ser Kevan Lannister's horse reared and threw him. Beric comes over and says that fire consumes until nothing is left, and that six times were too many.
Notch, Anguy, and Merrit take the watch. Late in the night, Arya sees the Ghost of High Heart enter the camp and seat herself next to Beric, Lem, and Tom. She tells them of the latest news. Balon Greyjoy is dead, and his men are fighting among themselves; Lord Hoster is dead too. She has also had more dreams. She dreamed of the goat sitting alone and fevered in the hall of kings as the great dog descends on him,1 a wolf howling in grief in the rain, a clangor of horns and drums and the sad sound of a little bell,2 a maid at a feast with purple serpents in her hair,3 and the same maid slaying a giant in a castle built of snow.4 She senses Arya and tells her to come closer. She says Arya is a blood child and smells of death. She bids Arya to leave, as she gorged on grief at Summerhall. Beric tells her they are taking Arya to her mother at Riverrun, and she tells them that Ser Brynden holds Riverrun, and Catelyn has gone to the Twins for the wedding.
It pours rain that night, and Edric, Lem, and Watty wake up with chills the next morning. They decide to wait out the storm in a nearby village. The rain does not let up as they ride, and soon Mudge and Merrit are getting sick too. Arya talks to Edric on the ride. He became a page for Lord Beric at seven when his Aunt Allyria was betrothed to him. At ten, he was raised to his squire and has served in that capacity for two years. Suddenly, Edric mentions Jon. He says they are milk brothers because his wet nurse, Wylla, was Jon's mother. Arya asks who he is, and he reveals he is Edric Dayne, the lord of Starfall. He tells Arya about his aunt, Ashara, who met Eddard at Harrenhal and fell in love with him there and later committed suicide for a broken heart. Arya rides away from them in anger. Harwin rides up to her after awhile and tells her it does not matter; Eddard was not betrothed, there was no stain on his honor, and they are all dead anyway. They arrive at the village, which has long been in ruins. Notch explains that it was Lord Goodbrook's village. He remained loyal to Aerys during Robert's Rebellion, so Lord Hoster descended on him with fire and sword. Thoros calls for a fire, which Jack-Be-Lucky, Notch and Merrit prepare. Thoros sees Riverrun in the flames, under attack by Lannisters. Lord Beric decides they must wait and figure out what is going on. Arya cannot take it anymore and dashes out into the rain. She is about to turn around and go back, when Sandor grabs her and drags her back to his horse.","Jaime still has a fever, but is no longer in danger of losing his arm. Qyburn will accompany him to King's Landing, and his escort will be led by Walton. Ser Aenys departed for the Twins three days before, and Lord Roose is departing at the same time as Jaime. Lord Roose asks Jaime to give his regards to Tywin, and Jaime tells Roose to give his regards to Robb, which the lord says he will.1 Several Brave Companions see them off, including Zollo, Pyg, Timeon, Shagwell, and Rorge, and Jaime promises to return to deal with them. Jaime rides with Roose for six miles before separating with an escort of two hundred men. Walton plans to avoid the kingsroad for greater safety. Qyburn rides up to Jaime and asks how he is. He sent Pia to Jaime the night before, but Jaime sent her away reluctantly. Qyburn also mentions that Lord Selwyn offered three hundred dragons for Brienne's return, but Vargo believes he is holding out. Jaime grows tired of Qyburn's company and rides up to Walton and Nage, who is carrying the party's peace banner. He wonders if his father has received his hand from Vargo yet and how he will respond. Tywin has never been one to act based on sentiment. When Tytos was still lord of the house, he imprisoned his unruly bannerman Lord Tarbeck, causing Lady Tarbeck to take three Lannisters prisoner including Stafford, brother of Tywin's betrothed, Joanna. She threatened to do them harm if any harm came to her husband, and Tywin said his father should send Lord Tarbeck back in three pieces. Tytos released him instead.
That night, Jaime has a dream that Tywin and Cersei abandon him and Brienne in the bowels of Casterly Rock where he faces the shades of Rhaegar and his brothers on the Kingsguard. The next day, Jaime asks Qyburn if he believes in ghosts, to which the man replies that he does believe a portion of the soul remains when a person dies, though none of the archmaesters cared much for his theories save Marwyn. Jaime makes a sudden decision to return to Harrenhal to rescue Brienne. Walton balks, but Jaime threatens to implicate Walton in the loss of his hand if refused, so he goes along. They arrive at noon, and Jaime is relieved that the gates are open for them. He hears cheering and realizes Brienne is in the bear pit. He arrives there to find her unarmored facing a bear while the Brave Companions look on. She bit Vargo's ear off, and this is her punishment. Brienne is not fairing well, and Jaime realizes she is only armed with a tourney sword. Jaime offers to ransom her, and Vargo tells him to go get her, so he jumps in the pit. He orders an astonished Brienne to get behind him and distracts the bear until Walton's archers, forced to intervene to save him, can come to kill it. This angers the Brave Companions, and Zollo, Three Toes, and Rorge draw their weapons, but Walton has them two to one. Vargo, saying he will be merciful, orders Jaime and Brienne pulled out of the pit and lets them leave unmolested. After they leave the castle, Brienne asks Jaime what made him come back. After thinking up several nasty retorts, he simply replies that he dreamed of her.","Robb sets out for the Twins in a light drizzle with a party including Catelyn, Edmure, and Lothar. Jeyne rides to join the party and begs to be taken along, but Robb sends her back to Riverrun. It was Catelyn's idea to leave her behind, as her presence could lead to great difficulty. Ser Raynald is the only Westerling with the group. The others remain at Riverrun save Ser Rolph, who was dispatched to Duskendale as soon as Lord Tywin consented to trade Robett for Martyn. They are protected by Ser Brynden, whom Robb has named to the new title Warden of the Southern Marches. With Ser Rolph gone, Grey Wind is at Robb's side once more. Galbart commands the outriders of Robb's army in Brynden's absence, while the Greatjon leads the van, Ser Wendel guards the baggage, and Robin leads the rear guard. The army is thirty-five hundred strong and consists almost entirely of Northmen; the lords of the Riverlands are staying behind to defend their lands while Robb retakes the North. Lady Maege and Dacey speak to Catelyn about the upcoming fight with confidence, but Catelyn is not so sure. Edmure spends most of his time with his friends and companions, including Ser Marq, Patrek, and Lord Lymond Goodbrook.
The rains get worse, and Galbart reports that the bridge at Fairmarket has washed away. They will have to take the road through Sevenstreams and Hag's Mire. Eight days later, they reach Oldstones. Robb asks Catelyn about the history of the place, which is mentioned in a song about Jenny of Oldstones. Catelyn remembers the one time she camped there as a girl when she pretended to be Jenny and Petyr was her Prince of Dragonflies.1 She explains that Oldstones was the castle of Tristifer IV Mudd, a king of the First Men who once ruled from the Neck to the Trident. He was known as the Hammer of Justice and won ninety-nine battles against Andal invaders but was defeated and killed in his hundredth when seven Andal kings joined against him. His successor, Tristifer V, was not his equal, and the kingdom was lost and House Mudd, which had ruled for a thousand years, was ended. Robb and Catelyn next talk of the succession. With Bran and Rickon gone, Robb needs to name an heir to serve in that capacity until Jeyne gives him a son. Catelyn says that Lord Rickard had no siblings but his father2 had a sister who married a younger son of Lord Raymar Royce of the junior branch. She had three daughters who married a Waynwood, a Corbray, and a Templeton. Robb silences his mother and states he wants to legitimize Jon, release him from the Watch, and designate him heir. Catelyn thinks this is a bad idea, fearing that he would harm Robb's own issue to secure his position. She points out that Aegon IV legitimized his bastards on his deathbed leading to five generations of Blackfyre pretenders before Ser Barristan Selmy slew the last in the Stepstones.3 Robb is angry at his mother's lack of support and stalks off.
The rain does not let up, and the progress slows to a crawl in Hag's Mire. Lord Jason catches up to the column there. He brings with him the captain of the Myraham, who reports that Balon Greyjoy is dead. What's more, his brother Euron returned to Pyke the very day Balon died and claimed the Seastone Chair. When Lord Sawane Botley objected, Euron had him drowned in a cask of seawater. Robb sees the opportunity here. He realizes that Victarion and Asha must return to Pyke to contest Euron's hold on the throne and that they will take most of their ships and captains with them, weakening the defenses at Moat Cailin. Robb tells Lord Jason to prepare two ships to return to the North. Galbart will be on one and Lady Maege on the other, and they will make for Greywater Watch to inform Lord Howland of the plan. After the wedding, Robb will divide his army into three battles led by himself, the Greatjon, and Lord Roose. While the Greatjon leads an attack up the causeway, Robb's battle will bypass Moat Cailin with Howland's help and fall on the castle from the rear. He also informs Catelyn that she will wait out the rest of the war at Seagard. Finally, he has his lords witness his royal decree naming his heir, presumably Jon.","Sam and Gilly come to an abandoned village that Sam prays is Whitetree, for otherwise they are hopelessly lost. Sam is in bad shape and on foot because his horse died three days into the journey. After a little poking around, he realizes with dismay that they are not at Whitetree. They take shelter in a long hall and go to sleep. Sam wakes up late that night in feeling extremely cold. He sees a shadow in the doorway. It is the wight of Small Paul and it comes toward them. He tells Gilly to get the horse while he faces Paul with the dragonglass dagger, which he took from Lord Commander Mormont after he died. Sam lunges at Paul and stabs him, but dragonglass proves useless against a wight and the blade shatters. Paul grabs him and begins to choke him, almost succeeding until Sam lurches and puts him off balance. He is able to grab an ember and destroy the wight. He goes outside to find Gilly surrounded by many more wights, including some of those lost on the Fist and after such as Lark, Softfoot, Ryles, Chett, and Hake. Suddenly, Sam notices thousands of ravens in the trees that descend upon the wights. A raven on Sam's shoulder tells him to go, and he grabs Gilly and flees. A strange cloaked figure riding an elk and dressed and hooded in blacks and grays calls Sam brother and bids them come to him. He helps them onto the elk, and when he grabs Sam, Sam realizes his hands are black and cold and hard as stone.","Sandor and Arya, on Sandor's horse, Stranger, reach the Trident, but it is too swollen to cross. Sandor decides to make for Harroway. When they arrive, the town is flooded, but the ferry Sandor was hoping to find is still there. He gets the ferryman to row him across. The ferryman wants his money first, but Sandor threatens him into rowing. They nearly collide with a tree and lose a man overboard before getting to the far shore. Sandor gives the Ferryman the paper from Beric and tells him ten gold belongs to him, and Sandor will return for the rest. When they stop for the night, Sandor tells her that he is taking her to the Twins to ransom her. He will also enter Robb's service if Robb will have him.","Jon rides hard to stay ahead of Styr's raiders. He is feverish, and his leg is in agony, but he is in time. He stops at Mole's Town briefly to change mounts and give warning, and then he completes the journey to Castle Black. The place seems deserted when he arrives. The only sign of life is a small wisp of smoke from the armory, so he goes there and discovers Donal Noye. Donal tells him they thought he had gone over to the wildlings, as Jarmen's scouting party, returned to Castle Black two weeks ago, reported seeing him with them. Jon says it is true to an extent, but he was following Qhorin's orders. Jon asks where the garrison is, and Donal explains that they are all along the Wall reacting to wildling incursions. He sees Jon's wound was caused by a wildling arrow and helps him walk to Maester Aemon. Jon tells Donal of Styr's raiders and asks how many are left at Castle Black. Only forty or so are there, crippled and infirm men and trainees commanded by the old and feeble-minded Ser Wynton Stout, who has been a ranger for eighty years. They arrive at the maester's chambers, and Clydas goes to fetch him. Jon lies down, and soon Maester Aemon returns to tend to him. Maester Aemon tells Jon of the mutiny.1 Only a dozen men returned out of the two hundred who left Castle Black, including Edd, Giant, and Grenn. Bowen is acting Lord Commander until there is a choosing. Jon keeps talking about what he learned and saw with the wildlings as Maester Aemon works, but he is delirious and ends up admitting that he broke his vows with Ygritte. Soon, he passes out. When he wakes up, Pyp and Grenn are with him. They tell him a few more of those who returned, Dywen, Donnel, Ulmer, Left Hand Lew, and Garth Greyfeather.2 Jon asks after Sam, and Grenn explains how he would not come. Maester Aemon comes and tells him about Winterfell, Bran, and Rickon. Grenn gives him something to help him sleep.","Robb's host approaches the Twins. Robb rides at the head with Catelyn, Edmure, and Ser Raynald. Four Freys ride to meet them, Ser Ryman and his sons Edwyn, Black Walder, and Petyr. When they come near, Grey Wind begins to growl and leaps forward, causing Petyr's mount to throw him. The Freys are cool and barely polite as they lead Robb towards the Twins. At the portcullis, Grey Wind starts howling and refuses to continue. Walder and Lothar come up and say he must fear the water and offer to give him over to the master of hounds. Robb has Ser Raynald stay with him instead. Robb enters the great hall, where Walder and Joyeuse await. Aegon sits at the base of the high seat, a half-wit wearing a fool's crown, and is obviously meant as a slight since he is usually kept hidden. Other Freys fill up the rest of the hall. Walder greets them with little courtesy and sends Ser Benfrey to fetch Roslin. Robb apologizes for his slight, and Walder says that he should apologize to his eligible daughters, granddaughters, and great granddaughters instead. He calls them all forward: Arwyn, Shirei, Amerei, a widow who had been married to a Ser Pate of Sevenstreams that was killed by Gregor Clegane, Marianne, Cersei, Fair Walda, Merianne, Tyta, Alyx, Marissa, and the twins Serra and Sarra. Another Walda comes forward as well, but she is the daughter of Walder Rivers, and he only wants true-born issue up front. Robb apologizes to the assembled women. Ser Benfrey then brings Roslin forward. Robb is about to leave to see to his men when Catelyn suddenly remembers to ask for bread and salt to secure guest right. Robb's men, including Edmure, the Greatjon, and Ser Marq, thank Walder for his hospitality, and Catelyn feels they are now safe.
Catelyn and Edmure inspect the bridal suite while Robb leads his army across the bridges. Edmure is suspicious about his bride, wondering if she might be barren, while Catelyn expresses surprise at how smoothly things are going. Catelyn returns to her room to change and then goes in search of Freys. She comes across a group in the great hall consisting of Lothar, Ser Raymund, Lythene Frey's husband Lord Lucias Vypren and his son Ser Damon, Ser Hosteen, Ser Leslyn Haigh, and his sons Ser Harys and Ser Donnel. She asks after Ser Perwyn and learns he is away.1 She then asks to be directed to the maester. She asks Maester Brenett if Roslin is barren and receives assurances that she is fertile and that her mother, Bethany Rosby gave Lord Walder a child a year of which five lived past infancy, Ser Perwyn, Ser Benfrey, Maester Willamen, who took his vows the year before and now serves Lord Eon Hunter, Olyvar, and Roslin.
Catelyn next goes to see Robb, who is closeted with Ser Wendel, Robin, the Greatjon, the Smalljon, and Lord Roose. Lord Roose has brought word of Lannisters on the Trident. Ser Wylis has been captured. He also reveals the deaths of Leobald and Cley, blaming the deaths on Theon as well. Ramsay has vowed to cleanse the North of ironmen. He also sent Roose a sample of Theon's skin. Robb wants Theon dead, but Roose opines that he is more useful alive and that they might extract concessions from the ironmen in exchange for his execution since he has the best claim to their throne. Robb reluctantly agrees. Roose tells Catelyn more of the Trident. Lord Roose was forced to cross in boats due to the flood, and Gregor Clegane fell upon him before the crossing was done. Ser Wylis had the rearguard, which was wiped out. Roose left a force of six hundred men at the river led by Ronnel Stout and Ser Kyle Condon, who had been Lord Medger Cerwyn's right-hand man, so Gregor cannot cross while the river is in flood. Lord Roose mentions Duskendale and blames Robett for marching there independently when he learned that Deepwood Motte had fallen.2 Roose now has five hundred horse and three thousand foot remaining. Robb tells him they are going home after the wedding.","Sandor and Arya are riding on a wagon with Stranger tied up behind. Sandor stole the cart from a farmer. They are stopped by outriders led by Ser Donnel, but Sandor says they are bringing salt pork and a warhorse courtesy of Lady Shella, and he lets them pass. They arrive at the castle, and a sergeant tells them to unload at the tents. Sandor drives the team towards the castle instead.","Catelyn watches Aegon prance around to music that is too loud. She sits between Ser Ryman and Lord Roose on the dais. Ser Ryman is truly drunk, and Lord Roose is only picking at his food. The wedding feast is poor, but Robb has been eating without complaint. Edmure and Roslin appear pleased with each other. Robb is seated between Alyx and Fair Walda. The wine is flowing freely. The Greatjon is drinking with Merrett, and Ser Whalen passed out trying to keep up. The Smalljon, Robin, Patrek, and Dacey are not drinking because they are serving as Robb's guards. Fat Walda is telling Ser Wendel how she became Lady Bolton. Grey Wind is not there, as Lord Walder refused to let him in. The Greatjon drinks Petyr under the table and begins to sing loudly. Roose takes his leave to search for a privy. Robb asks Ser Ryman where Olyvar is, as he hoped to have the lad squire for him again. Ser Ryman says he is gone. Catelyn mentions that she heard that one of his cousins was a singer, and Ser Ryman answers that it is Alesander, but he is gone too.1 Ser Ryman takes his leave. Lord Walder claps his hands softly, and Ser Aenys, Ser Hosteen, Lothar, Ser Marq, Ser Danwell, and Ser Raymund begin pounding their cups on the table. Lord Walder announces that the bedding should begin, and Roslin goes white and begins to cry. Robb agrees, and it begins, with the Greatjon carrying Roslin to the bed chamber on his shoulder.
Catelyn stays behind, as does Robb and a few others. Dacey taps Edwyn and asks him to dance, but he pushes her away violently and says no. Catelyn takes off after him as ""The Rains of Castamere"" begins to play. She grabs his arm and feels mail beneath. She slaps him, but he shoves her aside and walks on. Suddenly, it all makes sense to her, Olyvar, Perwyn, and Alesander gone, Roslin crying. Robb gets up to confront Edwyn, but suddenly has a crossbow bolt sticking in his shoulder and another in his leg, and he topples over. The Smalljon gets a table over Robb to save him from three more bolts as Robin is surrounded by Freys who stab him to death and Ser Wendel is felled by a quarrel through the mouth. The Smalljon attacks Ser Raymund with a leg of lamb, but takes a bolt while reaching for his sword that brings him to his knees. Lucas Blackwood is felled by Ser Hosteen, while Black Walder takes out a Vance wrestling with Ser Harys. Donnel Locke, Owen Norrey, and several others are felled by crossbow bolts, while Ser Benfrey grabs Dacey, who smashes him in the face with a wine flagon. She runs for the door, but Ser Ryman comes through with Frey men-at-arms and sinks his axe into Dacey's stomach. Northmen begin pouring through the other door, and Catelyn senses a rescue until one of them decapitates the Smalljon. Catelyn sees a dagger and goes for it, determined to kill Walder. At that point, Robb gets up. He has an arrow in his chest in addition to the other two. Walder signals a halt to the music and mocks Robb. Catelyn grabs Aegon and puts the dagger to his throat while calling out to Lord Walder and begging him to let Robb go, promising they will take no vengeance for what has happened. She says she will kill Aegon if Robb is not allowed to leave, but Walder does not care. A man in red armor and a pink cloak walks up to Robb, tells him Jaime Lannister sends his regards, and thrusts his sword into Robb's heart.2 Catelyn keeps her promise and slits the poor halfwit's throat. Catelyn goes insane and begins raking her face with her nails and sobbing uncontrollably. Someone says to put an end to it, and another person3 slits her throat.","Arya and Sandor are nearly at the gates of the Twins when they suddenly open to let out a large group of Freys. They knock down the three feast tents and set them alight and then begin doing the same to other tents as well. Three men come at Sandor, who mounts Stranger. Two come at him while the other heads for Arya. She throws a rock at him and runs around the wagon until Sandor returns from killing the other two. He kills him with an axe to the back of the head1. Arya wants to run to her mother in the castle, but Sandor says she must already be dead. She runs anyway, and Sandor rides her down and hits her in the head with his axe.","Tyrion and Sansa have dinner together. Tyrion is angry because of the troubles he is having with the Dornishmen. There was a fight that left a Tyrell man-at-arms dead and two Gargalen men scalded, and Lady Olenna caused a confrontation by calling Ellaria the serpent's whore to her face. Furthermore, Prince Oberyn always asks when the justice will be served. As Podrick clears the dishes, Sansa asks leave to go to the godswood, which Tyrion grants. Tyrion spends the next several hours trying to make sense of Petyr's ledgers. He seems to have been involved in a large number of shady deals. Ser Boros comes to summon him to Lord Tywin's chambers. When he arrives, Tywin is attended by Cersei, Ser Kevan, Pycelle, and Joffrey, who is exuberant. Tywin reports that Robb is dead and the war is mostly over now. Ser Brynden remains at Riverrun, but with Edmure hostage he dare not move. Lords Tytos and Jason will fight on for honor's sake, but the Freys can keep Jason penned up at Seagard, and it should be easy to get Lord Jonos to change sides and attack Lord Tytos. Tywin means to pardon all those who come back to him, save Harrenhal. Ser Gregor will put the castle to the sword. Joffrey says he wants all of their heads and wants to serve Robb's head to Sansa at his wedding. Tyrion says no and threatens him. Cersei appeals to Tywin to discipline Tyrion, but he instead instructs Joffrey on how to be a good king and how Aerys never understood that a man was less a king the more he had to show he was one. Joffrey retorts that Tywin was afraid of Aerys. Tywin dismisses Joffrey coldly and tells Tyrion and Cersei to remain.
Tywin chastises Cersei for Joffrey's behavior and dismisses her too. Tyrion says Joffrey is another Aerys, and Tywin says the king needs a sharp lesson. Tywin turns the subject to the difficulty he is having keeping Oberyn in line, as the man is half-mad. Tyrion asks if it is true that he tried to raise Dorne for Viserys at the end of Robert's Rebellion, and Tywin replies that this is true. Jon Arryn came to Sunspear personally to return the bones of Prince Lewyn and met with Doran to defuse tensions, but Robert never traveled to Dorne and Oberyn seldom left it. Tywin also reveals that he does not mean to give up Gregor. He means to keep Gregor far away while Oberyn is around and plans to tell him that Ser Amory killed Elia and her children to curry favor with Robert. Ser Amory did kill Rhaenys, but not the other two. Finally, Tywin reveals the price for the Frey betrayal. Ser Emmon has been granted Riverrun, while Lancel and Daven will marry Frey girls and Joy will marry one of Lord Walder's natural sons. Lord Roose has been named Warden of the North and will take Arya back with him. Tyrion asks how Arya can be going anywhere, and Tywin only says that Petyr may have succeeded where others have failed.1 Tyrion's son by Sansa will inherit the North in the end.","Salladhor Saan reports to a group including Stannis, Davos, Selyse, Ser Axell, and Melisandre that Robb is dead. The smallfolk are already calling it the Red Wedding. Stannis thinks he may be able to draw some of the Northmen and ironmen to his cause through an offer of pardons, but Melisandre says she has seen more usurpers in the flames. She, Selyse, and Axell are adamant that he must now give Edric to the flames to wake a dragon. Stannis is still not convinced, stating that Aegon III brought nine mages from across the sea to hatch dragons, Baelor the Blessed prayed over his eggs for half a year, Aegon IV had dragons of wood and iron built, and Aerion drank wildfire to become a dragon, but they all failed. Melisandre is starting to win him over, however. Davos speaks up in defense of the boy and points out that Joffrey is not yet dead. Stannis decides to postpone a decision until Joffrey dies. Davos stays after the others leave to continue to plead with Stannis, but only succeeds in angering him. Stannis mentions that he saw a king in the flames with a crown of fire that turned him to ash.1
Salladhor approaches Davos after he leaves and says he forgives him for turning down the plan to raid Claw Isle. He says Davos has many enemies among the queen's men, but knows he is making friends as well. Davos has been courting those who think that Stannis has turned from the gods to a demon of shadow, including Ser Gerald Gower, who fought well on the Blackwater, Ser Andrew, who had once squired for Stannis, and Ser Rolland, who commanded the rear guard as Stannis escaped from King's Landing. Davos goes to see Pylos and laments his lack of skill as Hand, stating he is not a highborn lord or great knight. Pylos counters that Ser Ryam Redwyne was the greatest knight of his day, Septon Murmison was a miracle worker, Lord Butterwell was witty, Myles Smallwood was courageous, and Ser Otto Hightower learned, but they were all terrible Hands. Kinship is no guide either, as Maegor Targaryen was a terrible Hand while Baelor Breakspear was a great one. On the other hand there was Septon Barth, a blacksmith's son whom Jaehaerys I elevated from the Red Keep library and gave the realm forty years of peace and prosperity. Davos insists he is unworthy because he cannot even read, so Pylos offers to teach him, and he begins coming every day to learn.
Several days later, Patchface waits outside the door for a lesson to finish as Davos approaches. Inside, Pylos is just finishing instructing Edric, Devan, and Shireen. They are reading of Daeron I and his conquest of Dorne, but Edric is not impressed because his father once won three battles in one day. He is referring to the early days of Robert's Rebellion when Lords Grandison, Cafferen, and Fell decided to join forces at Summerhall and put an end to Robert's insurrection. Robert learned of the plan and moved from Storm's End in time to take on each lord one by one as they arrived, personally slaying Lord Fell and capturing his son, Silveraxe. Pylos tells Edric not to boast, reminding him that Robert was not invincible, losing the battle against Lord Mace at Ashford as well as many tournaments. After they leave, Pylos suggest that Davos himself read Daeron's Conquest of Dorne, but he asks for a letter to read instead. There are no new ones, so Pylos chooses an old one. It is the letter from Bowen asking the five kings for aid. Davos is shocked to hear of the troubles at the Wall and realizes the Watch must be desperate if they are asking Stannis for help, since he has little strength left. He thinks of the first time he saw the Wall while serving on a ship called the Cobblecat. The ship's captain, Roro Uhoris, was a Tyroshi nicknamed the Blind Bastard despite being neither blind nor baseborn that decided to trade with wildling settlements along the Bay of Seals. The ship was caught by galleys out of Eastwatch, and Roro was executed for smuggling. Davos remembers the wildlings he met on the trip and thinks they were no worse than any other men, though one did steal the ship's cabin girl. He asks if Stannis has seen the letter, and Pylos states that he gave it to Lord Alester when it arrived. Davos considers what the letter might portend for the future and asks Pylos for a less troubling letter.","Jon watches Mole's Town burn. Styr will be at Castle Black soon. Jon can barely walk, but Donal agreed they need every man, so he is on the roof of the King's Tower leaning on a crutch and wielding a longbow. Jon shares the roof with Deaf Dick Follard, Satin, and six scarecrows dressed as brothers. The scarecrows were Maester Aemon's idea to make their numbers appear greater. The tower is not a very defensible position, but it will serve. Jon thinks back to when he first arrived at Castle Black and how Benjen explained to him why there are no proper defenses facing south. Lord Commander Runcel Hightower had tried to bequeath the Watch to his bastard son; Lord Commander Rodrik Flint sought to become King-beyond-the-Wall; Lord Commanders Tristan Mudd, Mad Marq Rankenfell, and Robin Hill all betrayed their vows, and the commanders of Snowgate1 and the Nightfort once went to war against each other. Each time the crisis was averted because Castle Black could not be defended, and the Watch continues to survive because it is not seen as a threat.
Donal had everything of value moved to the top of the Wall around the gate, where the Watch will make its stand. Grenn and Pyp are helping the last residents of Mole's Town evacuate. The defenders are mostly the old and infirm and trainees, including Mully, Kegs, Spare Boot, Easy, Dornish Dilly, Red Alyn, Young Henly, Old Henly, Hairy Hal, Spotted Pate, and Rast. Two whores from Mole's Town, Sky Blue Su and Meliana, are also part of the defense. The wildlings have not come by midday, when Owen the Oaf brings Jon and the others some food. Clydas and Maester Aemon relocate to the top of the Wall as Septon Cellador leads some of the brothers in prayer. Come evening, the wildlings have still not attacked.
The wildlings come at dark. Jon takes down several wildlings with arrows, and recognizes Big Boil hacking at the door to Hardin's Tower until taking an arrow in the leg. The great hall begins burning, and Deaf Dick points out wildlings on top of the armory. Suddenly, he is felled by an archer from below. Jon realizes it is Ygritte and cannot bring himself to fire before she vanishes. An assault force of fifty Thenns moves on the gate. Jon goes for more arrows and sees that a group of Thenns have breached the King's Tower and are getting on the roof. He and Satin kill the first two who try to make it through and pour boiling oil on the rest. Jon looks back to the barricade before the gate and sees that the Thenns are breaking through. He sees Rast, Old Henly, Young Henly, Easy, and Dornish Dilly go down. Kegs is almost caught too, but Satin saves him with a well-placed bolt. The Thenns advance towards the gate drunk on victory right into Donal's trap. He has placed oil and other flammables under the wooden steps and drenched them in oil as well. Jon, Satin, and other archers begin launching fire arrows at the steps. Nearly all the Thenns are killed in the ensuing conflagration, and Jon watches Styr disappear as a portion of the Wall collapses. When it is over, Jon descends to look for Ygritte, hoping she escaped. He finds Quort dead, Stone Thumbs nearly so, and Big Boil weak but alive. Finally he finds Ygritte with an arrow between her breasts. She stirs at his approach. He tells her she will be all right now that the battle is over. She merely tells him that he knows nothing and dies.","Bran, Meera, Jojen, and Hodor reach the Nightfort. Bran is full of fear, not only because they have reached the edge of the world, but also because he experienced a dream of Summer's that Robb and Grey Wind are dead. The Nightfort is the setting for some of Old Nan's scariest stories such as that of the Night's King, the Rat Cook, the seventy-nine sentinels, the rape and murder of Danny Flint, King Sherrit's curse on the Andals, the apprentice boys who faced the thing that came in the night, Symeon Star-Eyes and the hellhounds, and Mad Axe butchering his fellow Watch members in the dark. The castle has been abandoned for two hundred years. There is no way through to the other side of the Wall, just as Bran had already told the others, but Jojen had a green dream indicating they would pass through at the Nightfort and wants to look around. Bran sullenly states they should have followed Jon. The night Summer helped Jon escape,1 the direwolf killed three men, but took a wound from an arrow. The next day, the wildlings departed, but Jojen decided they should stay another day. Later that day, Summer returned and swam to the castle, where Meera treated his wound. The group then traveled to the Nightfort.
Meera decides to scale the Wall to look around, while Jojen and the others do the same in the castle. Bran tells Jojen a little about the castle as they search. It was the first castle founded along the wall and the largest, but it was also the first to be abandoned, replaced during the reign of Jaehaerys I with the smaller and more manageable Deep Lake. The castle is supposed to have many ghosts. One group are the seventy-nine deserters who went south to become outlaws. One was a Ryswell, so they sought shelter with the lord, but he turned them in instead and they were supposedly sealed alive in the ice, becoming known as the seventy-nine sentinels. As an old man, the lord took the black to stand beside his son. As it gets dark outside, Bran's thoughts turn to the Night's King, the semi-legendary thirteenth commander of the Watch who once spied a pale maiden from atop the Wall and chased her down to make her his queen. According to the legend, she took his soul and bound the Watch to serve his will, ruling as a king for thirteen years before the King in the North joined with Joramun to end his rule. After he was overthrown, the victors discovered he had been sacrificing to the Others and had all mention of him stricken from the records. When Old Nan would tell the story, she would end by saying no one knew who he was, but that he was speculated to be a Magnar from Skagos, an Umber, a Flint, a Norrey, or a Woodfoot from the house that ruled Bear Island before it was conquered by the ironmen, but that the real identity of the Night's King was a Stark.
After both groups find nothing helpful, they decide to spend the night in the kitchens, which make Bran uneasy, particularly the seemingly bottomless well. The story of the Rat King troubles Bran as they set up camp, a cook who killed two sons of an Andal king that had wronged him and served them to their father and was cursed by the gods for violating guest right by being transformed into a giant white rat that devoured its own young. They go to sleep, but after a time Bran is awakened by a noise. He realizes that someone or something is coming out of the well. He thinks at first it might be Mad Axe, who stalked the castle barefoot to kill his sworn brothers, or perhaps the thing that came in the night which was responsible for the death of three apprentice boys and drove a fourth insane according to the story. Bran crawls over to Meera and wakes her up, and she prepares to meet whatever is coming. Bran takes control of Hodor and has him pick up his longsword. The thing comes out of the well, and Meera traps it in her net. The form cries out not to hurt him and says his name is Sam. Gilly is there too with her baby. They came at the behest of Coldhands,2 who told them there would be people at the Nightfort that Sam should bring to him. Sam tells them there is a gate at the bottom of the well that can only be opened by a brother of the Night's Watch. It is called the Black Gate. Coldhands brought them to the castle, but he cannot pass through the Wall. Coldhands is not his real name, but what Sam and Gilly call him. Sam realizes who Bran is and promises to keep it a secret when asked to. Summer appears and seems to like Sam, which convinces Bran they should go with him. They descend deep into the well and finally come to the gate after many turns. It is a weirwood with an incredibly old face. It asks who they are, and Sam gives the oath of the Night's Watch. The face allows them to pass, the mouth opening wide to let them through. As Bran passes through the mouth, he feels a drop of water salty like a tear.","Daenerys beholds Meereen, larger than Yunkai and Astapor combined and built with bricks of many colors. The soldiers of the city have retreated to their formidable defenses save one champion who rides in front of the walls demanding that Daenerys send a champion forward to challenge him in single combat. Aggo, Jhogo, and Rakharo all insist on meeting the challenge, but they are too valuable for Daenerys to risk losing. Ser Jorah believes they should just leave the champion be, but Arstan argues that refusing the challenge builds courage for their enemies and plants doubts in their allies. He thinks they must accept for honor's sake. Daenerys has bigger things to worry about; she has eighty thousand people with her, but only a quarter are fighting men with the rest being freed slaves that will soon be starving. The rulers of Meereen practiced a scorched earth policy in the face of Daenerys's advance, leaving no food or water. They also placed a disemboweled slave child at each mile marker on the road from Yunkai to Meereen with an outstretched hand pointed towards the city. Daario, leading the van, began taking them down before Daenerys could see them, but she countermanded the order. There were one hundred sixty-three in total. Brown Ben Plumm, the new commander of the Second Sons, tells Daenerys that the champion is Oznak zo Pahl, a vicious man who once killed a friend of Ben's named Scarb for ""raping a woman with his eyes."" Oznak's uncle is the richest man in Meereen and his father commands the city watch. Ben was serving in the uncle's private guard when Oznak killed Scarb, and he was forced to flee the city before Oznak killed him too. Daenerys decides the challenge must be met and orders Belwas to fight him. Belwas walks out to meet Oznak, who charges him with his lance. Belwas avoids two charges and then disables Oznak's horse on the third pass. A short melee ensues in which Belwas kills Oznak. Belwas takes a wound, as he always lets his opponent cut him once, so Daenerys sends Missandei to get him a healer. Afterwards, she calls a council of war.
Daenerys sits with Rhaegal, Viserion, and Drogon, while Irri and Jhiqui attend the commanders. Daario is eager to loot Meereen, but Ser Jorah does not think the city can be taken. A siege is not possible due to a lack of provisions or wood to build engines, an assault on the seaward wall is impossible with only three ships, and the defenders can pour boiling oil down on any who would try to batter down the gates. Ben agrees with the assessment, while Grey Worm says his men could batter down the gates, but their losses would be large. Ser Jorah says they should leave the city be as their war is in Westeros. Daenerys sees that as a defeat, but Aggo, Jhogo, and Rakharo argue that those who hide behind walls are the real losers. Daenerys does not like this idea at all, particularly since many of the freed slaves will starve. Ben mentions the sewers that empty into the Skahazadhan, through which he escaped the city after the incident with Scarb. The climb would be arduous, and he refuses to go, but others are welcome to try. Daenerys thinks this does not sound promising, but will think on it.
As her captains leave, Viserion lands on Ben, and Daenerys observes that the dragon likes him. Ben claims to have Targaryen blood in his family through a Lord Plumm his grandmother told him had a dick six feet long and married a Targaryen princess.1 After Ben leaves, Daenerys's thoughts turn to Daario, who she is starting to take a fancy to. She thinks about marrying him and making him a a dragonrider, but is disturbed by the thought. She finally feels the need for some air and has Missandei saddle Silver. She takes Arstan with her and rides out among her people. She sees some of her Unsullied bathing in the sea and further out Balerion, Meraxes, and Vhagar at anchor. She next rides through the camp of freedmen. Ser Jorah has organized the fighting men into four strong companies, but they are not very disciplined. As she passes, the freedmen call out to her and come up to touch her stirrup or her leg. Suddenly, a man grabs her from behind, wrenches her to the ground and draws a sword. Daenerys realizes it is Mero as he prepares to kill her. Suddenly, Arstan challenges Mero and dispatches him easily with his staff. Upon returning to her tent, Daenerys summons Ser Jorah and asks why she was not informed Mero had escaped. He did not want to worry her. She orders Jorah to knight Arstan, but he refuses the honor, saying he is already a knight. Jorah recognizes him now, and says he is, in fact, Ser Barristan Selmy. Barristan says it is so and reveals that Jorah had been a spy for Varys. Daenerys is hurt and furious at both of them. She orders them both to leave, but has no idea where to send them. Suddenly, she realizes what they must do.2","Tyrion awakes next to Sansa and gets dressed. Sansa still refuses to accept him. When she learned of Robb's death, she waited until she was alone to show her grief. Tyrion has managed to keep the more gruesome details from her, such that Catelyn was thrown into the river naked in a mockery of Tully burial customs and that Robb's head was chopped off and replaced by the head of Grey Wind. His quarters are now in spacious apartments atop the Kitchen Keep that had belonged to Lord Gyles before Tyrion convinced Tywin that he required more suitable accommodation now that he was married. He has also hired more servants, including a woman named Brella who had run Lord Renly's household in the city. He goes to the storeroom where the Targaryen dragon skulls are kept and meets Shae. They have sex. Shae is now serving as a maid to Sansa, giving Tyrion an excuse to keep her close to him. Varys was reluctant to make the arrangement because it makes it more difficult to hide her background and expressed his confusion as to what quality Shae possesses that would make a clever man like Tyrion lose all his wits. Tyrion reflects on the risks he is taking. He thinks it is time to send her away to Chataya's brothel or marry her to Bronn or even Ser Tallad, who has shown an interest in her. As they prepare to leave each other for the day, the sun begins to rise on the first day of the new century.","Sansa wakes up lamenting that she is all alone now, with everyone she cared about dead. Brella and Shae bathe her and dress her for breakfast with Cersei. The wedding is that night. Tyrion arrives with Podrick in tow and also gets ready for breakfast. At breakfast, Dontos and Moon Boy entertain, and Ser Balon and Ser Osmund guard the king. After breakfast, Cersei presents Joffrey with the wife's cloak he will give to Margaery, the same she wore when she married Robert and Joanna wore when she wed Tywin. Next, Joffrey is presented with gifts, as it is tradition in the Reach to give presents to bride and groom on the morning of their wedding. Jalabhar Xho, Lady Tanda, Ser Kevan, Prince Oberyn, Ser Addam, Lord Mathis, Lord Paxter, Tyrion, Lord Mace, and Lord Tywin each present gifts. Joffrey is not impressed with Tyrion's gift, Lives of Four Kings, Grand Maester Kaeth's history of the reigns of Daeron I, Baelor, Aegon IV, and Daeron II. He adores Tywin's gift however, a Valyrian steel blade that he names Widow's Wail. Ser Addam warns him it is sharp, and Joffrey responds that he is no stranger to Valyrian steel and uses the blade to chop up Tyrion's gift. Ser Garlan tells him it was one of only four illuminated by Grand Maester Kaeth himself, and Joffrey merely responds that now there are three. He asks Tyrion for a better gift, and Tyrion suggests a Valyrian steel dagger with a dragonbone hilt, which leaves Joffrey speechless.1
As Tyrion and Sansa leave breakfast, Oberyn and Ellaria fall in with them. Oberyn states he once saw the Citadel's copy of ''Lives'' and thought it was too kind to Viserys II, whom Oberyn says poisoned King Baelor and then ruled for just over a year without doing much of anything. Tyrion retorts that Baelor starved to death while fasting and that Viserys was an able Hand for fourteen years for both Daeron I and Baelor, essentially ruling the realm for both before taking the throne in his own right. He also comments that someone had to save the realm from Baelor. Sansa is shocked to hear Baelor criticized, as he is revered as the king who made peace with Dorne by walking barefoot down the Boneway and saved the Dragonkinght from a pit of vipers. Ellaria adds that while legend has Baelor escaping the snake pit unharmed due to his piety, he was actually bitten fifty times and should have died, and the venom may have been partially responsible for his later descent into madness. Oberyn asks how Tyrion accounts for Joffrey since there are no vipers about, and Tyrion abruptly ends the conversation. Tyrion and Sansa get in their litter, and Tyrion asks Sansa if there was any bad blood between Joffrey and Bran, to which Sansa responds there was not.1 Tyrion tells her he never hurt Bran and does not want to hurt her either.","Tyrion looks on as the High Septon marries Joffrey and Margaery. He reflects on the attempt on Bran's life and how Joffrey had to be the one to order the killing. He still does not know why, but figures it was probably to impress Robert.1 After the seven vows are made and seven blessings received, Lord Mace removes Margaery's maiden cloak while Tommen hands Joffrey the bride's cloak to place on her shoulders. After the ceremony is over, the wedding procession makes its way out of the Great Sept. Ser Loras and Ser Meryn lead the way, followed by Tommen spreading rose petals before Joffrey and Margaery, after the king and queen come Cersei and Lord Mace, then Lord Tywin and Lady Alerie, then Lady Olenna and Ser Kevan shadowed by Erryk and Arryk, then Ser Garlan and Lady Leonette, and finally Tyrion and Sansa. Ser Addam and his men hold back the cheering crowd as the bride and groom receive congratulations from the wedding guests. Tyrion and Sansa return to the Red Keep in their litter. Tyrion tries to break through her wall of courtesy on the way but fails. When they arrive, he relieves himself and returns to his chambers, where Podrick has laid out his clothes for the feast. Sansa is changing at the moment, so he just takes some wine, sits and, thinks. The War of the Five Kings is nearly over. Gregor Clegane has taken Harrenhal; Black Walder has forced Seagard to yield; Lord Randyll has captured Maidenpool; Ser Daven and Ser Forley have linked up to march on Riverrun, soon to be joined by two thousand men led by Ser Ryman, and Lord Paxter is almost ready to sail his fleet to Dragonstone. Podrick brings up changing again, and he enters the bedchamber, where Shae is just finishing with Sansa. She looks beautiful, yet extremely sad. Shae asks Sansa if she may serve at the feast, and Tyrion is forced to tell her there is no room for her.
Sansa and Tyrion go to the feast. As Sansa makes the rounds, talking with Lord Gyles, Elinor Tyrell, Jalabhar Xho, Lancel, out of his sickbed for the first time and thin with brittle hair and ready to collapse, and Ser Kevan, Tyrion realizes that she would make a great queen. Lady Olenna comes up, straightens Sansa's hair, and offers to take her to Highgarden when she leaves in two days. Sansa declines. Tyrion and Sansa enter the throne room for the feast, with Lady Olenna following escorted by Erryk and Arryk. Soon after, Joffrey and Margaery ride in on horses. After they take their seats, Tywin, Kevan, Lancel, and Cersei embrace Margaery while Mace, Loras and Garlan do the same for Joffrey. The High Septon says a prayer as Tyrion takes his seat by Garlan and Leonette, and then Joffrey declares the beginning of the feast. Tyrion looks around at all the happy women in the hall, such as Margaery, Lady Alerie beside Lord Mace, Alla, Elinor, Megga, Lady Taena, and Ellaria with Prince Oberyn at a special table as far from the Tyrells as possible, and wishes his wife would love him and be happy.2 Hamish the Harper is the first to sing, performing a new composition telling how Renly repented in death and rode to King's Landing to save Joffrey. Other entertainers follow, including a dancing bear, Moon Boy, Butterbumps, a troupe of Pentoshi tumblers, Collio Quaynis of Tyrosh, Dontos and Moon Boy, four pyromancers, and many other performers as courses come and go. The next singer, Galeyon of Cuy, sings a song of the Blackwater that says nothing of Tyrion. Tyrion is bitter, and Garlan next to him explains to Leonette how Tyrion saved the city. The song is seventy-seven verses, and Grand Maester Pycelle is asleep by the end of it.
After a brief altercation between one of Lord Mathis's men and a Dornishman, a very drunk Joffrey calls for the jousters. They are dwarves,3 and Tyrion immediately sees the insult directed at him. After a comic show, one of them yields, and Joffrey declares that he must fight Tyrion to determine the champion. Tyrion stands on the table and says he will ride the pig if Joffrey rides the dog because the king is the only man he could hope to defeat. An enraged Joffrey has to be restrained by Ser Meryn and Ser Osmund. As Alaric of Eysen prepares to perform, Joffrey comes over to Tyrion and dumps wine on his head. Tyrion and Margaery attempt to defuse the situation, and Joffrey orders Tyrion to fill his cup for a toast. Lord Tywin announces that the pie has arrived, and Joffrey fetches his sword to cut it. Margaery points out that Widow's Wail should not be used to slice a pie, and Joffrey calls for Ser Ilyn to provide his sword. He no longer has Ice, which shocks Tyrion and Sansa.4 After Tyrion cuts the pie open to allow the pigeons to fly out, servants serve actual pigeon pie. Joffrey comes over and eats Tyrion's piece, washing it down with more wine. Suddenly, he starts coughing violently. As the assembled watch in horror, Joffrey chokes to death. Tyrion looks at the wine chalice in his hand, which still has a little wine in it, and pours it out. Cersei lets out a scream when it is over, and it takes two Kingsguard to pry her fingers off Joffrey's body. Cersei orders the Kingsguard to arrest Tyrion for the murder of Joffrey.","As the bell begins to toll announcing Joffrey's death, Sansa, in the godswood, feels elation. She had fled the throne room before he died, as had Lady Tanda. Sansa takes out the clothes she has hidden and dresses for her flight. As she takes off her hairnet, she notices that one of the gems is missing. When Dontos arrives, she accuses him of using the stone to poison Joffrey, but he denies it and also tells her that Tyrion has been arrested. Dontos, drunk, leads her out of the godswood. He is wearing his surcoat, wanting to be a knight at least for the rescue. He leads her down a long dark gallery and out of the castle to a cliff side. There is a hidden ladder carved into the cliff. Sansa balks at first, but Dontos tells her it is the only way. At the bottom, a man named Oswell is waiting with a skiff. He rows them into the bay.
Near dawn, they approach a trading galley. Oswell helps Sansa up on deck, and Lothor Brune wraps his cloak around her. It is Lord Petyr who has rescued her. Dontos asks for his reward, ten thousand dragons, and three crossbowmen kill him at Petyr's command. Sansa is horrified, and Petyr says he was her benefactor all along. He could not approach Sansa openly, but after Sansa saved Dontos he made the perfect go-between. It was Petyr who sent her the note telling her to come to the godswood if she wants to go home. As he takes her to her cabin, Petyr also reveals that the jousting dwarves were provided by him. Sansa asks why he killed Joffrey, and he states that he had no motive and that sometimes it is good to make moves that seem to have no reason in order to confuse one's enemies.1 Petyr tells her that he loved Catelyn, but could not marry her. He also claims he took her maidenhead.2 He tells Sansa she is safe and going home.","Jaime learns in an inn that Joffrey is dead, though the stories differ as to how and who. The next day, the party arrives at King's Landing with Jaime, Walton, and Nage with the peace banner at its head. Jaime is anxious to see Cersei again, but feels surprisingly little emotion over losing his firstborn son. He never really had an opportunity to become close to him. Jaime rides to the rear to find Brienne, who has stayed aloof from the others and pretended not to be part of the group. She has been listless since they learned from Ser Bertram Beesbury at Brindlewood that Robb and Catelyn are dead. Ser Bertram also told them that Lord Clement Piper had renewed his fealty to the Iron Throne with his son1 a prisoner at the Twins. Jaime offers to send her home or offer her a place in King's Landing, but neither option appeals to her. A guard waves them through the Mud Gate past a long line of wagons waiting to enter the city, and they ride up to the Red Keep. The gate is guarded, but a startled Ser Meryn lets them past. In the yard, Ser Loras and Ser Balon also greet the group. Loras recognizes Brienne and draws his sword meaning to kill her for the death of Renly. Jaime manages to stop him, but Loras still wants her arrested, and Jaime sees that she is.
Jaime goes to the sept to see Cersei, who is praying for Joffrey. Ser Osmund guards the door and does not recognize him at first, but finally lets him through. Cersei is disheveled and amazed to see him. She tells him of Tyrion's threat to turn her joy to ashes2 and says he killed Joffrey. Jaime is starting to believe this, but he recoils at doing what she wants, killing Tyrion in his cell. He forces himself upon her, and they have sex. When it is over, Jaime tells her he wants to be with her openly and marry. Tommen would lose the throne, but he does not care. Cersei says he has changed and makes him leave. Jaime goes to see Tywin. Tywin had expected him earlier. Varys had reported his escape soon after it occurred, and Tywin sent Gregor, Ser Samwell Spicer, Ser Dennis Plumm, Ser Peter Plumm, and Ser Harwyn Plumm to look for him. Lord Roose had passed on word as well. Lord Tywin is shocked to see the hand, however. When Jaime tells him it was Vargo, Tywin says that the Brave Companions deserted him and Gregor found him in Harrenhal half-mad with pain and fever from a wound to his ear that festered.3 He is not dead yet, but will be soon; Gregor has taken off his hands and feet. The Companions have scattered. Turning to Joffrey, Tywin has had Podrick and Sansa's maids4 detained and questioned, and Ser Addam is searching for Sansa. Lord Tywin tells Jaime it is time for him to leave the Kingsguard and take up his rightful place at Casterly Rock. He wants to send Tommen to be Jaime's ward and squire to get him away from Cersei and also hopes to marry Cersei to Oberyn. Jaime says he means to stay in the Kingsguard. After a long silence, Tywin tells Jaime he is not his son and tells him to attend to his duty.","Davos watches from above as Melisandre leads the evening devotions. Stannis, Selyse, Shireen, Axell, and Devan are among the devotees, though Stannis is not fervent as the others are. Ser Andrew tells Davos it is time, and they set to work along with Ser Gerald and Ser Rolland. Other members of their conspiracy include Lewys the Fishwife and Ser Triston of Tally Hill, a former sworn sword to Lord Guncer Sunglass. They go to Maester Pylos's room, where he is teaching Edric sums. Pylos tells Edric to go with Davos. Edric resists at first, but Davos cajoles him into coming. The four join Lewys and Omer Blackberry at a postern gate where they have tied up the guards. Mad Prendos, one of Salladhor's ships, waits to take Edric away. Everyone goes with him save Davos and Rolland. Davos makes the long lonely walk to the Stone Drum and up to the Chamber of the Painted Table and waits. After awhile, Davos hears Stannis and Melisandre approaching. Melisandre is telling Stannis that she saw Joffrey dead in the flames, but Stannis will not be convinced until the information is verified. Davos announces that Joffrey is indeed dead. Salladhor's ships still trade in King's Landing, and one brought back the news. Melisandre says that Stannis must give him Edric now, and Stannis reluctantly agrees there is no other way. Davos tells them what he did. Stannis is angry and draws Lightbringer, but gives Davos a chance to explain. He says a king must protect his people and pulls out a scrap of paper.1","Jon wakes from a disturbing dream, lonely because Ygritte and Ghost are gone. He hears two loud horn blasts signaling wildlings approaching. With the stairs a charred ruin, the winch is the only way up to the Wall now. Jon waits his turn with Satin, Mully, Spare Boot, Kegs, and Hareth, a stablehand who wants to take the black and one of the few citizens of Mole's Town still aiding the Watch in the defense. Zei, a whore who proved adept with a crossbow during the attack by Styr's raiders, and three orphan boys whose father died on the steps during the raid also stayed; everyone else fled back to their hovels or fields. Clydas and Hobb provide refreshment as they wait. When the cage finally arrives, Jon joins Donal at the top of the Wall. They hear a strange noise, which Jon identifies as mammoths. Donal orders their two trebuchets to launch burning pitch at the oncoming attackers to provide illumination. When this is done, they see giants approaching on over a hundred of mammoths. Alyn sounds his horn again and the wildlings answer as the battle is joined.
Pyp shouts that they are at the gate, and Donal tells him and Owen to drop lamp oil through the murder holes while Grenn chucks other debris down on their heads as well. As the battle continues, a slightly drunk Septon Cellador begins singing prayers, but Donal shuts him up. Donal orders the archers to begin firing and chooses four men to go with him to hold the gate below. He leaves Jon in command. The battle rages on and Cellador begins praying again. After awhile Hobb, Clydas, and Owen bring food to keep the men refreshed. One of the trebuchets breaks from the strain of constantly firing. Dawn finally comes, and the men on the Wall behold a gigantic host of wildlings. The night attack was only a probe; the real battle is just beginning. The line is centered by giants on mammoths, and the giants have a huge ram as well. Chariots of bone manned by men from the Frozen Shore anchor the flanks. The men are scared, but Jon gives a rallying speech and they prepare to meet the host. Jon orders the archers to target the ram but wait for his command. As the wildling advance, their formation comes apart. When the ram is in range, Jon gives the order, and he, Satin, Grenn, Owen, Spare Boot, Black Jack Bulwer, Arron, Emrick, and Zei let loose their arrows and quarrels. The ram goes down and the wildlings are thrown into disorder. A mammoth reaches the gate, and Grenn, Pyp, and Kegs toss down burning pots of oil. At that, the wildlings break and withdraw.
Jon's leg is in agony now, and he has Pyp help him off the Wall, leaving a horrified Grenn in charge. Jon decides to inspect the gate, and Pyp brings back Maester Aemon and Clydas with the spare key. They pass through the iron gates and find everyone dead, including Pate and Donal. The giants busted through the outer door, and a single giant, Mag, wrenched the bars off the first iron gate, though Donal killed him. Jon says they must block the gate and that Ser Wynton must take command. Maester Aemon states Wynton will merely smile, nod, and forget any conversation they have. Thirty years ago he came within a dozen votes of being named Lord Commander, and even ten years ago he would have been up for the task, but now he is too feeble. Jon says Aemon himself should lead then, but he says his order gives counsel not commands. He says Jon is the only one who can lead them until the garrison returns.","Arya has an empty place inside now that her parents and brothers are all dead.1 She would sleep all day and all night if Sandor did not make her go on. Her dreams are the best part of her life now. She enters Nymeria in those dreams and presides over a huge pack of wolves. They have two horses now, Stranger and Craven, a sorrel palfrey discovered wandering aimlessly the morning after the slaughter at the Twins that Arya named after Sandor said he had probably run from the Twins just like them. Sandor no longer watches her closely, but she does not run because she has no idea where she would go. She feels abandoned by Gendry and Hot Pie, and resents that Lord Beric just wanted to ransom her. She feels none of them ever wanted her around. They ride all day long every day, but Sandor refuses to tell her where they are going. They see other people from time to time, usually groups of Frey armsmen searching for stray northmen. One day, they come across a mortally wounded archer in service to Ser Marq who describes how a Bolton man befriended and then attacked him at the Red Wedding. Sandor gives him water and mercy, killing him quickly. After looting the corpse, they continue.
They reach the foothills of the Mountains of the Moon, where Sandor finally reveals he intends to attempt to ransom Arya to Lysa. Arya says they should return to the Twins to rescue Robb and Catelyn instead, but he dismisses this as nonsense. That night, she enters Nymeria and can smell her mother. She wades into the river and pulls the corpse out. Just then, a group of men approach, and she must abandon her prize.2 The next morning, she accepts that Robb and Catelyn are dead. As they move deeper into the hills, Sandor and Arya come to an isolated village, and Sandor decides they need to stop for food and rest. The townsfolk are building a new palisade, and Sandor agrees to help in the labor for food, ale, lodging, and some coin. He also learns that taking the high road will be impossible due to both the weather and the renewed depredations of the mountain clans. The Burned Men have been fearless since Timett returned from the war, while Gunthor led the Stone Crows in a raid on a village eight miles away in which they stole all the women and killed half the men. The clans have good steel weapons and armor now, and the Stone Crows, Milk Snakes, Sons of the Mist and other clans watch the road closely. After two weeks in the town, Sandor decides they should just stay for a while until the situation in the Riverlands calms down, but the next day, they are turned out by the village elder, who recognizes Sandor and does not want any trouble. Sandor is paid with some copper, sour ale, and a sword that he trades for with his axe. He decides to make for Riverrun again to ransom Arya to Ser Brynden. Arya suggest the Wall, but he thinks that is a bad idea.","Tyrion discusses his upcoming trial with Ser Kevan. Kevan reveals that Tywin will sit in judgment, but due to his personal connection to the case he will have Lord Mace and Prince Oberyn sit with him. Tyrion asks if he will be allowed trial by combat, and Kevan replies that he will but that Ser Gregor would serve as Cersei's champion. Tyrion asks about finding witnesses, and Kevan replies that he will attempt to produce anyone that Tyrion names, but that he cannot leave his cell save for the trial itself. Tyrion asks for Podrick, and Kevan goes to get him. Tyrion tells his uncle he did not poison Joffrey, but Kevan does not believe him. As he tries to think of witnesses in his support, Podrick arrives. Tyrion tells his squire to bring Bronn and tell him there is more gold in it for the sellsword than he could possibly imagine. Podrick does not return that day, and Tyrion finally thinks of his only witness, Sansa. Kevan returns and tells him the trial will start in three days. He also says that he will bring Sansa to share Tyrion's cell if she can be found, but neither Ser Addam or Varys have had any success locating her. Podrick finally returns with Bronn the next morning, but Bronn is not in a helpful mood. Cersei has arranged for him to marry Lollys Stokeworth, and the wedding is in two days. Bronn gives Tyrion a chance to offer a better price, but Tyrion cannot do so. Bronn leaves.
On the morning of the trial, Ser Addam and a dozen goldcloaks come to escort him to the throne room. Hundreds are there to see the trial, including Margaery, flanked by Lady Alerie and Lady Olenna. Lord Tyrell, Prince Oberyn, and Lord Tywin sit at the foot of the dais. After the High Septon says a prayer to the Father to guide them to justice, the trial begins. Lord Tywin begins by asking Tyrion if he killed Joffrey, to which Tyrion responds in the negative. The prosecutions witnesses then begin to testify. Ser Balon is the first to come forward, who proclaims disbelief of Tyrion's guilt but describes the moment after the riot when Tyrion struck Joffrey.1 Ser Meryn testifies next to the same incident and also to the time Tyrion stopped Joffrey from beating Sansa.2 Ser Boros testifies to this event as well. Tyrion wants to tell the crowd what Joffrey was doing to Sansa at the time, but he is ordered to stay silent. Osney and Osfryd come next one after the other to describe Tyrion's threats towards Cersei the night she arrested Alayaya,3 though the whore is not mentioned. Ser Osmund follows and tells a lie of how Joffrey confided to him on the day he was raised to the Kingsguard that Tyrion meant to kill him and rule in his place. Tyrion lashes out at this, and Tywin threatens to chain him like a common brigand if he does not stay silent. The trial ends for the day. That night, Tyrion asks Ser Kevan to bring Varys, hoping the eunuch will speak for him.
The next day, Maester Ballabar and Maester Frenken open the testimony by recounting how they opened Joffrey's throat and found nothing obstructing the airway. Grand Maester Pycelle follows. Pycelle shows the assembled various poisons Tyrion took from his room while he was imprisoned. Tyrion points out that none of those could have done the deed, and Pycelle says it was the strangler and that Tyrion must have used it all. Tyrion gives another outburst, and Tywin threatens to gag him if he speaks again. A progression of witnesses follow, including, Lord Paxter, Lord Ardrian, Ser Flement, Lord Gyles, Ser Hobber, Lord Philip, Lady Taena, Lord Estermont, Josmyn Peckledon, Galyeon, Morros, and Jothos, who all testify to various acts at the wedding feast itself.
That night when Kevan comes, Tyrion realizes that his manner has changed because he now believes Tyrion guilty. Tyrion asks after Sansa and Varys, but the former has not been found and the latter is to testify against him the next day. Ser Kevan urges him to confess and says that Tywin will let him take the black if he does. Tyrion is disdainful and distrustful of the offer, but Ser Keven gives an impassioned plea for Tyrion to trust Tywin. He knows Tywin is a hard man, but claims there were good reasons for it. Tywin's own father, Lord Tytos, was amiable and week. His bannermen mocked him and openly defied him, while debts to the house went unpaid. His mistress even stole his wife's jewels. Tywin restored House Lannister to its proper place and became Hand of the King at age twenty. He gave the realm twenty years of peace and plenty as Hand, but the only thanks he received were numerous slights to his honor from an envious Aerys II. Tyrion realizes that Ser Kevan loves Tywin greatly and promises to think over the offer.
Varys testifies the whole next day, confirming most of the previous testimony with documents. At the end of the day, Cersei says she will call one final witness on the morrow.4 That night, Tyrion receives a surprise visit from Prince Oberyn. Oberyn tells him that Cersei has hinted at marriage if he will condemn Tyrion. He has no desire to wed Cersei. He is pleased Tyrion stands accused of the crime; otherwise it might have been him. He knows poisons, has reason to keep House Tyrell away from the throne, and Myrcella, who as the next-eldest child would inherit by Dornish law, is betrothed to his nephew. Oberyn turns the talk to justice. He believes that Tyrion is innocent and wants a chance to avenge Elia both by killing Ser Gregor and Tywin. He says he will serve as Tyrion's champion in a trial by combat.","Jaime peruses the White Book as he waits for the rest of the Kingsguard to arrive. He feels a stranger to his own family now and thinks himself unworthy to follow such distinguished Lord Commanders as Barristan the Bold, Ser Gerold Hightower, Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, Ser Ryam Redwyne, the Demon of Darry, Ser Duncan the Tall, and Alyn Connington, the Pale Griffin. He reads the bio of Ser Barristan. The firstborn son of Ser Lyonel Selmy, Barristan squired for Ser Manfred Swann and was named ""the Bold"" in his tenth year when he competed as a mystery knight at Blackhaven and was unmasked by Prince Duncan Targaryen. Knighted by Aegon V Targaryen in his sixteenth year after entering another tournament and unhorsing both Prince Duncan and Ser Duncan the Tall, he slew the last Blackfyre pretender, Maelys the Monstrous in single combat during the War of the Ninepenny Kings. Named to the Kingsguard at twenty-three, he rode against the Kingswood Brotherhood, rescuing Lady Jeyne Swann and her septa from the outlaws and slaying Ser Simon Toyne; rescued King Aerys II Targaryen during the Defiance of Duskendale despite taking an arrow wound to the chest while avenging the death of fellow Kingsguard Ser Gwayne Gaunt, and led the assault on Old Wyk during Greyjoy's Rebellion. Jaime also looks at his own, much smaller, entry, which states, among other things, that he rode against the Kingswood Brotherhood as squire to Lord Sumner Crakehall when he was fifteen and was knighted by Ser Arthur Dayne for valor in the field. He recalls that he saved Lord Summer's life that day when Big Belly Ben was about to bash his head in and also stood toe-to-toe with the Smiling Knight, though it was Ser Arthur that killed him. Ever the gallant knight, Ser Arthur had allowed the Smiling Knight to fetch a new sword at one point because his was so full of notches.
When the rest of the Kingsguard finally arrive, Ser Boros and Ser Meryn take seats to his right, while Ser Osmund, Ser Balon, and Ser Loras sit to his left. Jaime berates them for letting Joffrey die and asks them if Tyrion killed him. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros are sure he did, while Ser Balon is not so sure and Ser Loras thinks it was Sansa. Jaime tells the assembled that Tommen will be king and that he intends to make sure the boy lives to a ripe old age. Jaime assigns Ser Boros to taste Tommen's food henceforth and insults the man when he balks. Ser Boros finally relents when Jaime challenges him to a sword fight, before leaving in disgust. Jaime is glad Boros did not take him up on the offer, as in his state Boros could have won easily. He next turns to Osmund to learn more about the man and is disquieted to learn he is merely a sellsword who fought with a company called the Gallant Men in the Stepstones and Disputed Lands. He may not even be a knight, as his story of being knighted on the battlefield by a Ser Robert Stone appears dubious. Jaime dismisses him and focuses on Ser Meryn. He chastises the knight for beating Sansa at Joffrey's order and tells him that from now on he will obey only Tywin, Cersei, and Jaime; part of protecting the king is protecting him from himself. After dismissing Meryn he turns to Balon. He welcomes Balon, but worries that his brother, Ser Donnel, fought for Renly and Stannis, while his father1 did not call his banners and remained at his seat at Stonehelm. Ser Balon explains that his father is past forty and done with fighting, while his brother was captured by Ser Elwood Harte at the Blackwater and swore fealty to the crown with all the others. Though Ser Donnel is Tommen's man now, however, Jaime wonders what Balon will do if that changes. Balon assures Jaime he will do his duty.
Finally, Jaime turns to Loras. As they begin to banter, Jaime realizes that Loras is just like him at that age. He asks Loras who wore Renly's armor in the fight against Stannis2 and learns it was Ser Garlan at Lord Petyr's suggestion. He asks after Renly's remains next, and learns that Loras buried the man himself in a secret place. Finally, he turns the conversation to Brienne. Loras still thinks she is guilty but has his doubts. Renly's gorget was cut through, which no man could have done. Furthermore, it made no sense to armor him and only then slit his throat. Jaime tells him to question Brienne. If he is still convinced she did it, Jaime will punish her for it; otherwise, Loras must let her go free.","Lothor helps Sansa up to the forecastle of the Merling King. The crossing has been rough and full of storms, and Sansa has spent most of the voyage below decks sick. Lord Petyr joins her as she looks out at a lonely tower on a desolate stretch of the Fingers. Petyr tells her it is his keep and that they are going ashore. Sansa thought they were going to Winterfell, but Petyr says it is sacked and burned and her new home is with him. The nameless keep does not look inviting to Sansa at all, but Petyr assures her they will only stay a fortnight, until Lysa arrives. Petyr and Lysa are to marry.
Lothor and Oswell row Sansa and Petyr ashore. Petyr's household, such as it is greets, them. They are Grisel, his housekeeper and former wetnurse, Umfred, his steward, Bryen, his captain of the guard, and Kella, who tends the sheep flock. They go to the hall for food. Hanging in the hall is the shield of Petyr's grandfather, whose own father was a Braavosi who came to Westeros as a sellsword for House Corbray. When Petyr's grandfather was knighted, he took the head of the Titan of Braavos as his sigil. When they are alone, Petyr tells Sansa she must take an assumed identity because Varys has spies everywhere and it is not safe to be Sansa Stark. She will be Lord Petyr's bastard daughter and go by the name Alayne, which was the name of Petyr's mother. Her cover story will be that her mother was the daughter of a merchant prince of Braavos that Petyr met in Gulltown when he was in charge of the port and died giving birth to her. She was then entrusted to the Faith, but decided at her flowering that she did not want to be a septa and therefore wrote to Petyr, who did not know she existed before that.
After the food arrives, Petyr speaks of the game of thrones and how to be a player instead of a piece. Sansa brings up Dontos, and Petyr says he could not have been trusted to poison Joffrey; his job was merely to make sure Sansa brought the hairnet. He brings Oswell in, who reveals that Osmund, Osney, and Osfryd are his sons and in Lord Petyr's employ. They did not do it either, however, as they also could not be trusted. Petyr says it was Olenna who did it. When he brought the marriage proposal to Highgarden, he had his men spread rumors of Joffrey's cruelty. He also planted the notion of Loras joining the Kingsguard, knowing that his temper and Joffrey's cruelty could lead to an ugly situation. Olenna did not want any harm to come to her granddaughter, so when Lord Mace appeared determined to make his daughter a queen no matter what, she conspired with Petyr to murder Joffrey so that Margaery could marry Tommen instead.1
Lysa arrives eight days later with a small retinue. She is overjoyed to see him and obviously loves him. Lord Yohn Royce has been demanding she call the banners and go to war, and Eon Hunter, Lyn Corbray, and Nestor Royce have all been trying to wed her, but the only person she wants is Petyr. She demands that Petyr marry her immediately despite his desire to do so at the Eyrie, because she is eager to share his bed and make another child.2 Petyr acquiesces. After the wedding feast and the bedding, Petyr and Lysa have rather loud intercourse. Marillion, who came with Lysa, makes advances at Sansa, but Lothor, who Petyr ordered to watch out for Sansa, drives him off.
The next morning, Sansa is summoned to Petyr and Lysa. Petyr tells her that Lysa knows who she is now and that they are leaving for the Eyrie that afternoon. Petyr leaves and Lysa talks to her. She says Sansa looks too much like Catelyn, and they will have to darken her hair. They talk of Sansa's marriage to Tyrion, and Lysa laments how she had no choice in her own marriage as well. The only one she wanted was Petyr, but he was too lowborn. Lord Jon put Petyr in charge of the customs at Gulltown to please her, and when he increased income tenfold, Lord Jon kept giving him more appointments until he finally became master of coin. Meanwhile, Lord Jon impregnated her six times with three boys and three girls, but only Robert survived infancy. Lysa says that she will protect Sansa. She wishes she had killed Tyrion when she had the chance and is angry at Catelyn for taking Ser Brynden, as the mountain clans have grown bold. She is confident that Petyr will sort them out after she names him Lord Protector of the Vale, however. Lysa is glad Joffrey is dead because he used to call her son cruel names and even slapped him with a wooden sword once. She wants to wed Sansa to Robert as soon as Tyrion is dead. She is especially pleased that Robert will have a young companion again, as she had to send away Ser Vardis Egen's boy and her steward's sons because they were too rough with him. She says Sansa is nothing but a beggar now and must be a gracious and obedient wife to Robert.","Owen wakes Jon for another day of combat. The attacks have been constant over the last few days, as has the noise of Mance constructing some new siege engine. All the men sleep on the Wall now, as the winch takes too long. Only Maester Aemon, Ser Wynton, and a few others either old or ill remain at Castle Black. As he emerges from his shed, wildling archers with rolling mantlets approach the Wall. They launch arrows in this fashion every morning,and three days ago one of them took Red Alyn in the leg, after which he fell off the Wall. Jon uses a telescope to scan the wildling encampment. Mance is not in sight, but he sees Val and Dalla outside Mance's tent. He also sees the turtle Mance is building, a wooden frame on wheels covered with hides that will be used to assault the Wall. Jon has planned a counter, and asks Grenn if the barrels were filled. He says they are ready, and Jon sends him off to rest. Jon sees Tormund examining the turtle and Varamyr walking in the woods.
The sound of the winch announces Hobb arriving with the morning meal, but Jon has no appetite. Things are not going well. The Watch is almost out of oil and arrows, and the pitch is completely gone. A raven came from Ser Denys at the Shadow Tower reporting that Bowen met three hundred wildlings led by the Weeper in battle. They were victorious, but losses were heavy. Ser Endrew Tarth and Ser Aladale Wynch were killed, and Bowen himself seriously injured. He is being tended by Maester Mullin, but will not be well enough to return to Castle Black for some time. Jon sent Zei to Mole's Town when he got the news to plead with the villagers to help. She never returned, and when Jon sent Mully after her, they discovered that the whole town has been abandoned. Jon makes himself eat, and Hareth announces that the turtle is coming forward. Kegs sounds his horn and the men of the Watch, including Pyp, Satin, Owen, Tim Tangletongue, Mully, and Spare Boot, prepare for another fight.
Jon orders the men to open fire as the turtle approaches, but neither fire arrows, nor catapults, nor scorpions can harm it. Jon prepares to drop his barrels, filled with gravel and ice, on the advancing turtle. Four barrels leave the turtle a wreck, and the wildlings withdraw. Exhausted, Jon leaves Pyp in charge and goes below. He sleeps in his cell and awakens to see four strange men standing over him. They are men of the Watch, and they take him to the Lord Commander's solar. Maester Aemon is there, as are Septon Cellador and Ser Wynton. The others are unfamiliar to him save Ser Alliser. The men must be reinforcements from Eastwatch. Their leader is Janos Slynt, who accuses Jon of oathbreaking with Ser Alliser egging him on. Jon explains Qhorin's orders and admits to sleeping with and caring for Ygritte. Janos has one of his men, Ser Glendon Hewett, bring forth Rattleshirt. He describes how Jon killed Qhorin. Janos considers Jon a traitor, despite Maester Aemon's words on his behalf, and orders him hanged.","Tyrion pokes at a sausage and mulls his options. Joining the Night's Watch seems the best option, but he does not trust that Tywin will actually let him take the black and also resents confessing to a crime he did not commit. Podrick arrives to tell him Ser Addam waits to escort him to the last day of the trial. As Tyrion takes his seat before Lord Tywin, Lord Mace, and Prince Oberyn, Shae is brought in.1She tells lies about how Tyrion plotted the murder with Sansa and would have killed Cersei and Tywin too to be Hand to Tommen, who would then be killed so he could be king. She admits to being his whore but lies that she was supposed to marry a squire before she caught Tyrion's eye. She says that Tyrion made her call him her giant of Lannister. Ser Osmund begins laughing first, soon joined by Ser Boros, Ser Meryn, Ser Loras, Cersei, and then most of the room. Tyrion shouts to get their attention and tells Tywin he will confess. He confesses not to killing Joffrey, but to being a dwarf. He says he is not the monster everyone says he is, but that there is no justice for him here. He demands trial by battle. Cersei says Ser Gregor will stand for Joffrey, and Prince Oberyn stands for Tyrion. Lord Tywin sets the time for the event for the next day and leaves with Ser Kevan at his side.
That night, Tyrion eats and thinks. He is pleased because no matter who wins there will be trouble. If Oberyn wins, the feud between Dorne and Highgarden will grow worse. If he loses, then Doran will be furious. The next morning, Tyrion attends Oberyn as he prepares for battle with the help of Ser Daemon, Ser Arron, and Lord Dagos2. He tells Tyrion he should come to Sunspear when the combat is over and hints that he could help Doran place Myrcella on the throne. Oberyn then tells Tyrion more of what happened when he visited Casterly Rock years ago. He and Elia were touring much of the south and west, including Starfall, the Arbor, Oldtown, the Shield Islands, Crakehall, and Casterly Rock, with their mother to explore marriage prospects. Doran did not come because he was already betrothed to Mellario of Norvos. Elia was excited by the trip because her fragile constitution gave her little opportunity for travel, while Oberyn spent his time making up mocking names for her suitors. None of the potential suitors were particularly interesting, however, save Baelor Hightower, Lord Leyton Hightower's heir, who Elia was taken with until he farted and Oberyn named him Baelor Breakwind. Even now, Baelor, called Baelor Brightsmile, is a handsome knight of high renown, and Tyrion wonders how events might have played out differently if not for that one mocking name. Oberyn believes the unsatisfactory suitors were a deliberate part of a scheme cooked up between his mother and Lady Joanna, who were old friends that had been companions of Princess Rhaella Targaryen in their youth, to see Elia wed to Jaime and Oberyn married to Cersei. Joanna had died right before they arrived, however, and Tywin refused the offer, stating that Cersei was reserved for Rhaegar. He also offered Tyrion as a match for Elia instead of Jaime, a grave insult. In the end, it was Elia that married Rhaegar, not Cersei, and Oberyn hints that his sister's fate may have been in part revenge for that slight. He is ready to see justice for Elia.
The outer ward, the sight of the combat, is crowded with hundreds of spectators eager for the show. Cersei stands with Gregor, who is an imposing sight. Even Ellaria is worried now, but Oberyn is unconcerned. Lord Tywin and Ser Kevan observe from a platform erected halfway between the contestants. The High Septon calls on the Father to judge the combatants as Ser Osmund brings Gregor his shield. As the combatants approach, Oberyn announces who he is and begins taunting Gregor over and over with the same litany about Elia: ""You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children."" He continually feints and darts away, tiring and disorienting Gregor. The constant taunting angers Gregor, who finally lunges at Oberyn and gets within range. Oberyn manages to dodge Gregor's blows. They approach the crowd, and Gregor accidentally takes off a stableboy's arm. When the lad screams, Gregor lops half his head off. Oberyn finally manages to strike Gregor under the arm and at the knee to bring him down. He yells at Gregor to say Elia's name. Oberyn gets a running start and vaults Gregor, driving his spear through Gregor's belly and pinning him to the ground. He takes Gregor's greatsword and stands over him to finish it. Gregor grabs Oberyn and brings him to his chest. As he says Elia's name, insults her, and admits to raping and killing her, he pushes his gauntleted hand into Oberyn's eyes, smashes his teeth, and then crushes his head. Tyrion retches as he is condemned and guards escort him to the black cells.","Daenerys gazes over Meereen from the top of the Great Pyramid. She has court soon, so Irri, Jhiqui, and Missandei bathe her and dress her. Daenerys took the city in the night. She had siege engines constructed by dismantling Balerion, Meraxes, and Vhagar. At the height of the assault, the men she sent through the sewers freed the slaves, and the city fell. She staked out one hundred sixty-three of the slave masters in the same manner as the children on the road to Yunkai as vengeance for that atrocity. Daenerys descends to her audience chamber, where Aggo, Jhogo, Rakharo, Grey Worm, Ben, and Daario await. They report the city is calm. After the initial looting, Daenerys decreed that murderers would be hanged, thieves lose a hand, and rapists their manhood. This seems to have kept the city quiet for the moment. There are flies everywhere, and Daenerys orders the bodies cleared away. She has second thoughts about her punishment, but still believes it was just. Missandei tells her that the Ghiscari inter their dead in crypts below their manses and suggests she returns the bones to their families. Daenerys agrees it will be done. Daario tells her two men request an audience. They arrived last night on the Indigo Star out of Qarth. The first is a pale, ferret-faced man named Ghael, who speaks for King Cleon of Astapor. Ghael explains that the council Daenerys left in the city betrayed her trust and Cleon executed them to rule as king. Missandei tells Daenerys that Cleon was a butcher in service to Grazdan mo Ullhor. Cleon offers an alliance with Daenerys against Yunkai. Ghael says that Yunkai is training new armies and has sent envoys to New Ghis, Volantis, and even Vaes Dothrak. He offers to seal the alliance by marrying Daenerys. She says she will consider it and sends him away. The captain of the Indigo Star tells her that the people of Astapor are starving and lawlessness is rampant. King Cleon has seized the noble children of the city to train new Unsullied. The captain is there for slaves. Daenerys says none are for sale, but Daario tells her that many people are down at the docks begging to be sold, as they will have higher status in the free cities as tutors, scribes, bed slaves, healers, and priests. Daenerys declares that anyone who wants to sell themselves into slavery can, but no child will be sold and no husband will sell his wife. Missandei tells Daenerys that the masters of Astapor always took a tenth of the price, and Daenerys says she will do the same. Daario says the Stormcrows will collect the price.
Belwas brings Barristan and Jorah before Daenerys at her command. Barristan has shaved his beard and looks ten years younger. On the night Meereen fell, she sent two hundred men to burn the ships in the harbor as a diversion so that they and Belwas could lead twenty picked men through the sewers to release the fighting slaves and win the city. She asks Barristan why he served Robert, and he explains that he was pardoned and Viserys was too young to rule and already showing signs of madness. He tells Daenerys that Aerys was mad, something she always assumed was a lie spread by Robert. Barristan hid his identity from Daenerys so he could observe her and find if she were mad too. This offends Daenerys at first, but Barristan explains that madness has always been a problem for the Targaryen dynasty and recounts how King Jaehaerys II once told him that madness and greatness are two sides of the same coin and that every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin while the world holds its breath. When Daenerys realizes that Barristan knew her grandfather, she sees that he can tell her more of her family's history and identity than any other man close to her and accepts him into her service.
Daenerys turns her attention to Ser Jorah, who remains insolent and unapologetic for his actions. He swears he was always loyal and protected her, yet he sent his last report as late as Qarth. She is angry that he told Varys of her child. He counters that he saved her from the poisoner. Daenerys asks how he knew, and he explains that Varys sent a warning and said he only wanted her watched, not harmed. Jorah says he must be forgiven, but Daenerys says she cannot do so. Reluctantly, she banishes Jorah from the city and her side. Daario offers to kill him after he is dragged out by Belwas, but Daenerys says to let him be. Daenerys tries to read for awhile, but is too distracted by what she has just done. She goes out to the terrace, where Rhaegal and Drogon are resting. She spots Viserion in the distance, hunting. Her dragons are growing bolder every day. Ser Barristan approaches and wonders if she has questions for him. She asks if Aerys was truly mad, and Barristan replies that he was. He was generous and charming, which endeared many to him, but as his reign progressed, he lapsed into madness more and more. Daenerys does not want to hear more at the moment, and he leaves. That night, Daenerys has trouble sleeping as she thinks of those who betrayed her. The next morning, she announces to her captains that her dragons need time to grow and she needs to learn how to do more than conquer a city and move on, so she will stay in Meereen for a time and rule as queen.","Jaime watches as Ser Kevan gives Tommen documents to sign, including bills of attainder against Ser Edmure and Ser Brynden for rebellion, a decree granting Riverrun to Ser Emmon, a decree legitimizing Ramsay Snow, a decree naming Lord Roose Warden of the North, a decree raising Ser Rolph Spicer to Lord of Castamere, and royal pardons for Lord Gawen Westerling, Lady Sybell, Jeyne, Lord Jonos Bracken, Lord Karyl Vance, Lord Lymond Goodbrook, and Lord William Mooton. Jaime is distressed because Ser Addam completely routed him in a sparring match, and it is obvious that he has lost all of his fighting skill. Jaime prepares to take his leave. Ser Kevan tells him he should see Tywin, but Jaime says the rift between them is of Tywin's doing and that hollow gifts will not sway him. Ser Meryn is guarding the door as Jaime leaves. Out in the yard, Walton is forming up his men. They are leaving with a girl posing as Arya Stark.1 Nage raises the peace banner, and the party rides off. Jaime notices the dark spot marking where Gregor killed the boy during the trial by combat and thinks of Gregor, whose wounds have mortified. Pycelle has said he was poisoned and will die if he does not learn what poison was used. Tywin wants him healed so he can be executed to placate Doran. He is worried because Stannis has disappeared from Dragonstone and may be making for Dorne to ally with Doran.2
Jaime returns to his apartments and finds Cersei waiting for him. She is there to have him plead with Tywin not to send her away. She is to go back to Casterly Rock, and Tommen is to marry Margaery. Jaime brings up the assassination attempt on Bran and asks if Cersei did the deed, which she denies. She mentions that Robert, drunk, said in front of her and the children that Bran should just be killed for mercy, and Jaime realizes Joffrey did it to impress Robert. Cersei pleads with Jaime again not to let Tywin take Tommen from her, and he says he cannot do anything. Cersei says Tywin may listen if he leaves the Kingsguard, but he refuses. He says again that they should acknowledge their relationship publicly, and Cersei says they cannot. Cersei tries to have sex with him, but Jaime rebuffs her. Cersei becomes furious, mocks him, and leaves. Jaime goes downstairs and tells Ser Boros to have Ser Loras bring ""her."" Several hours later, Ser Loras arrives with Brienne. Loras now believes that Stannis may have killed Renly. Jaime gives Brienne the Valyrian steel sword his father gifted to him and tells her to find Sansa and take her someplace safe. The sword was one of two Tywin had made from Ice.3 Jaime says it must be named Oathkeeper. Brienne agrees to find Sansa. When she leaves, Jaime writes in the White Book of his defeat, capture, and maiming.","Jon is being lowered down the side of the Wall in a cage. After four days in a cell, he was brought before Lord Janos and Ser Alliser. Maester Aemon has written to Cotter protesting Jon's imprisonment, and Janos can no longer hang him. Instead, he is sending Jon as an envoy to Mance, who has asked for a parley. Lord Janos wants Jon to kill Mance. Jon walks through the gate and is met by Tormund, who shares his mead as they walk to the wildling camp. He asks after Ygritte and is sorry to hear she is dead. He also says that Longspear Ryk stole his daughter Munda while her four brothers, including Toregg and Torwyrd,1 slept through the whole thing. Mance waits outside his tent flanked by Harma and Varamyr and is not at all pleased to see Jon. Neither is Varamyr, who took Orell's eagle as his own and has absorbed his hatred for Jon. Mance tells him that they know how many men the Watch has and how few supplies they have left. He takes Jon inside to talk alone. Val and Dalla are there as well, and Dalla will be giving birth anytime now. Jon is shocked to see the Horn of Winter sitting there. Mance did not tell Jon about it because he never trusted him. Mance says that he could attack all three Watch castles at once or send men to dig out gates at the abandoned castle, but he does not do it because his people have bled enough. The Others have been hounding them relentlessly, and no one has been able to stop them. He is not moving south to conquer as Raymun Redbeard. Bael the Bard, Gendel and Gorne, and the Horned Lord did; he is running. He does not want to sound the horn because if the Wall falls nothing will stand in the way of the Others. He tells Jon that if the Watch lets his people pass through; he will turn over the Horn of Winter. Jon asks if he is really a king, and Mance answers yes, though not in the southern sense. The wildlings follow fighters. When he deserted the Watch, five men including Tormund and Styr were contemplating becoming kings; Mance bent Tormund and Styr to his cause and slew the other three. Jon asks if he can make his wildings obey the law, but Mance says they would not kneel. If the Watch refuses his terms, Tormund will blow the horn in three days.
Suddenly, a horn sounds. Mance goes outside, and Varamyr tells him that riders are coming from the east, including men in black. A group of rangers appear, and Harma rides past to meet them with thirty raiders. Mance sees they are Eastwatch men and figures Cotter Pyke thought he could take Mance just as he took Rattleshirt at Long Barrow. Mance mounts his horse to join his men. He orders Varamyr to watch Jon and kill him if he flees. Suddenly, Varamyr screams, and Jon sees his eagle on fire.2 Val comes out wondering where Mance is because the birth is beginning. Jon sees the rangers give way before Harma, but they are supported by a group of knights. Jon tells Val to go inside the tent. Three columns of heavy horse emerge. One smashes into Harma's raiders, while another engages Tormund, his sons and his spearmen. All is confusion among the wildlings. The giants on their mammoths engage the center column and scatter it, but the other two keep coming. Jon holds his ground as women and children run past and Varamyr slinks away on all fours. More and more men emerge from the trees behind a yellow banner. Mance tries to rally his men, but his horse is killed under him. The wildlings break and run. Jon sees Harma's head on a pole and then sees gigantic royal standards bearing a flaming heart and the prancing stag. Jon thinks for a second it is Robert, even though that is impossible, until he hears men crying out the name Stannis.","Arya and Sandor stop at an inn, where Sandor means to get some wine. Arya considers running when Sandor goes inside, but takes Stranger and Craven to the stables instead. When she goes inside, she recognizes Polliver and the Tickler. A squire is with them as well,1 and he mocks Sandor despite the Tickler's attempts to silence him. Polliver tells Sandor the news, including Tyrion's marriage, Joffrey's death, and the taking of Harrenhal. Save for a cook who opened the postern gate and a couple of wenches, everyone at Harrenhal was put to the sword. Riverrun is under siege, and Lord Walder has threatened to hang Edmure if Ser Brynden does not yield. Only the Blackwoods are still holding out elsewhere, and the Brackens are fighting them around Raventree.
Sandor asks if there are ships at Saltpans, and Polliver says all he knows is that the traders have returned to Maidenpool since Randyll Tarly took the town and locked Lord William Mooton in a tower cell. The Tickler says Gregor would prefer that Sandor stayed around, and when Sandor returns an insult, the Tickler sends a knife at his throat. Polliver draws his sword, and he and Sandor fight. The squire draws too, but Arya knocks him down by throwing her wine cup Sandor is drunk and not holding his own very well, and the Tickler moves in behind him. Arya can see he is losing and prepares to intervene when the squire wrenches her around. Arya takes his knife from its sheath and stabs him in the belly. Polliver and the Tickler back Sandor into a corner and try to make him yield, but Sandor kicks a bench at Polliver and takes half the man's head off while he is distracted. The Tickler backs away in fear. Arya sneaks up behind him and stabs him over and over again in a rage until Sandor stops her. The squire is still alive but mortally wounded. Sandor tells Arya to give him mercy, and Arya draws Needle, which Polliver was carrying, and does so. Sandor, seriously wounded, says Gregor must hold the ford and that they will make for Saltpans and find a ship to the Vale. Sandor needs help mounting Stranger. They go into the wilderness and halt when they reach the Trident. Sandor has Arya pour boiling wine over his wounds and passes out from the pain.
The next day, Sandor is weak and has to stop at noon. He falls out of the saddle and barely has enough strength to drag himself to a tree. He falls into a fevered sleep, and Arya draws Needle, intending to kill him. Sandor wakes up and tells her to give him mercy, trying to anger her into doing so. Arya decides he does not deserve mercy and leaves him to die. Six days later, she arrives at Saltpans. The town has been burned out, but there are three boats in port. Two are only riverboats, but the third is seaworthy. Arya realizes she needs silver and sells Craven. She heads to the ship in the port and asks the captain for passage to the Wall. The captain2 says she does not have enough and that he is sailing for home anyway. Arya asks the name of the ship, and he replies it is the Titan's Daughter out of Braavos. Arya pulls out the coin Jaqen gave her and tells the captain ""valar morghulis"". The captain responds with the words ""valar dohaeris"" and tells Arya she will have a cabin.","Sam, Jon, and Val look on as Gilly feeds Mance's baby.1 Sam and Gilly walked along the Wall from the Nightfort until they met Ser Denys riding from the Shadow Tower with Bowen and the survivors of the battle with the Weeper, including Dywen, Giant and Edd. He learned from them how Stannis landed at Eastwatch and Cotter led him along the ranger's roads to surprise the wildlings. When they arrived at Castle Black, they found it filled to bursting with Stannis' soldiers. Pyp and Grenn greeted them and explained that Stannis left Selyse and Shireen at Eastwatch, bringing no women with him save Melisandre. Melisandre burned a man to give Stannis fair winds north to reach the Wall.2
Val has heard that Stannis plans to burn Mance as soon as he is strong enough. Jon explains that the Watch would have hanged him as a deserter already, but he is Stannis' prisoner. Val wants to see him and let him hold his son, but no one is allowed near him save Maester Aemon at the moment. Jon and Sam leave. Jon notes how fond Sam is of Gilly, but reminds Sam he cannot keep her. Sam is considering writing to Lord Randyll claiming that Gilly's baby is his so that he will take them in. Jon is bitter because Bowen has removed him from duty. Ser Alliser and others still call him a turncloak, but few really believe it. Talk turns to the choosing for Lord Commander. Ser Alliser was briefly in the running, but finished sixth on the first day and lost votes on the second, so he withdrew to support Lord Janos. Sam assures Jon that Janos will not win, but Jon says he has been winning for days already. Jon leaves to train recruits. With Ser Endrew dead, Castle Black has no master-at-arms, so Jon has been training Satin, Hareth, Hop-Robin, Arron, and Emrick. When they have duties, he trains for hours by himself.
Sam thinks on Jon's words. It is true that Janos has been slowly gaining support, passing first Bowen and then Othell, but he is still behind Ser Denys and Cotter, far short of the two-thirds majority needed to win. Sam goes to Maester Aemon's chambers and helps Clydas tend the wounded. Sam continues to think of the choosing. There were thirty candidates at the beginning, but only seven now. Ser Denys leads with two hundred thirteen votes followed by Cotter with one hundred eighty-seven, Lord Janos with seventy-four, Othell with sixty, Bowen with forty-nine, Hobb with five and Edd with one. Everyone's total has been falling save that of Lord Janos. Sam joins Pyp and Edd at dinner. Pyp is telling Edd about the scarecrows they used as decoys on the Wall and how the scarecrow named for Watt of Long Lake took the most arrows, and Edd mentions that Watt died in the battle at the Gorge. Another vote for Lord Commander is happening that night, and he sees Cotter surrounded by Eastwatch men and Ser Denys surrounded by Shadow Tower men. He notes with disquiet that Lord Janos has the best place in the hall and is talking to Bowen. Pyp points out that Ser Alliser is speaking with Othell.
After dinner, Maester Aemon presides over the choosing. At the start, Bowen withdraws and pledges his support to Lord Janos. The brothers cast their votes by casting different shaped tokens into a large pot. Afterwards, Maester Aemon sorts them and Sam and Clydas tally them up. This time, Ser Denys falls to two hundred three and Cotter to one hundred sixty-nine. Lord Janos rises to one hundred thirty-even, while Othell gets seventy-two, Hobb five, and Edd two. That night, Sam shares wine with Pyp and Grenn. He says they need to convince Denys and Cotter to join forces to stop Janos. Pyp points out that he and Grenn are ill-suited for the task, and that only Sam can do it. Sam says he would, but he is too scared to face them.","Jon practices with Satin. Satin becomes uneasy, and Jon turns to see Melisandre watching him. She has come to summon Jon to Stannis. He asks for a moment to change and goes to his quarters to don fresh blacks and fetch Longclaw. They ascend to the top of the Wall together. Jon asks if she is cold, and she reveals she is always warm. Stannis waits atop the Wall. He tells Jon that he has heard all about him but believes Jon is no turncloak because he knows the nature of both Janos and Eddard. Jon downplays all his accomplishments holding the Wall and securing Mance's son. Stannis thinks he captured Mance's wife as well, but Jon explains that Dalla died and he holds her sister, Val. Jon mentions Varamyr going mad when the eagle burned, and Melisandre confirms it was her doing. Stannis quizzes Jon on the honor of the wildlings in general and of Mance, Rattleshirt, and Tormund, who escaped after the battle, specifically. Next, he tells how Davos convinced him to come to the Wall so he could win the throne by saving the kingdom. He believes he will meet the foe he was born to fight, the Great Other, here and wants Jon to do his part to fight that war as well. Stannis tells him that Roose has been named Warden of the North and that the ironmen are fighting amongst themselves yet still hold Moat Cailin, Deepwood Motte, Torrhen's Square, and most of the Stony Shore. He needs a loyal Lord of Winterfell and a son of Eddard Stark to woo the northmen. He wants Jon. Jon says he is already sworn to the Watch, but Melisandre says he swore to false gods and the vow is meaningless. Jon does not want to forsake his vows and betray his father's gods. Stannis reveals some of his plans. He means to settle the wildlings in the Gift if they swear fealty to him and adopt the Lord of Light as their god. He wants to marry Jon to Val to help cement the alliance. Jon says he needs time to think. Stannis says he can have a little time, but not much.","Tyrion hears noises outside his cell and believes his time has come. The door opens, and it is Jaime there to rescue him. As they leave the cell, Jaime tells him Varys drugged the guards and is waiting to take him out of the city through the sewers and to a rendezvous with a galley. Jaime says he is rescuing him because of a debt he owes. Tyrion presses him, and he admits that Tysha was not a whore; Tywin made Jaime tell the lie because Tyrion needed a sharp lesson. Jaime swears he did not know Tywin would give her to the guards, but Tyrion is too furious to believe him. He swears revenge on Jaime, Cersei, and Tywin and says he will find Varys himself. Jaime asks if Tyrion killed Joffrey, and he reveals that Cersei was sleeping with Lancel and Osmund and also claims to have killed Joffrey. Jaime walks away. Tyrion thinks to call after him and take back what he said, but he thinks of Tysha once more and keeps quiet. Tyrion finds Varys, who leads him down pitch black passages until they are in a dimly lit hallway with a dragon mosaic on the floor. Tyrion recognizes it as the place Shae described to him once,1 and Varys confirms they are beneath the Tower of the Hand. Tyrion asks how to get to the bedchamber, and Varys tells him while protesting there is no time. Tyrion begins to climb the ladder up the tower. At the top, he can hear two of his father's guards, Lester and Lum, talking about Tyrion's impending execution. He enters the bedchamber through a secret door in the fireplace and hears Shae's voice. He finds her in his father's bed with the chain of office around her neck. Tyrion strangles her and then takes a crossbow off the wall. He goes to the privy tower, where he finds Tywin. Tywin appears unconcerned and tells Tyrion he still means to sends him to the Wall. Tyrion has just one question: what did Tywin do with Tysha. Tywin says he did not kill her and that the steward probably sent her on her way. Tyrion shoots him with the crossbow. Tywin's bowels loosen as he dies, and the stench proves that Tywin Lannister did not, in fact, shit gold.","Stannis and Melisandre meet with Maester Aemon, Bowen, Lord Janos, Ser Denys, Cotter, Othell, Hobb, and Edd. Sam is there to help Maester Aemon up and down the steps. Stannis is displeased the Watch does not yet have a new Lord Commander. Maester Aemon explains that the Watch has chosen its own commander since Brandon the Builder raised the Wall, and that they have chosen nine hundred and ninety-seven in unbroken succession. Lord Janos wants Stannis to endorse him, but Stannis despises that idea. Janos had given places and promotions in the city watch for money and killed two men ready to expose him. Lord Jon had presented the evidence to the small council, but Robert did not care, and Petyr was in on the corruption and taking the crown's share of the bribes. Stannis tells the assembled that he does not mean to involve them in his quest for the crown but needs them to defend the Wall. He also says he means to take the Gift and rebuild and garrison all the abandoned castles along the Wall. He prefers to do this legally with the consent of the Watch but will do so by force if necessary. The Watch will also begin lighting nightfires. He says he has not come to fight petty squabbles, but the fight for life itself. Maester Aemon states he means the war of the dawn and asks where the prince who was promised is. Melisandre declares Stannis is he. Stannis orders everyone to leave save Maester Aemon and Sam. Stannis quizzes him on killing the Other. He says there is much dragonglass on Dragonstone, and his castellan there, Rolland Storm, will mine what he can before the castle falls. He also asks about the Black Gate at the Nightfort and says he will make his seat there. Maester Aemon asks to see Lightbringer before he goes, with Sam acting as his eyes. Stannis dismisses them with one final threat to choose a Lord Commander that night. After they leave, Maester Aemon points out there was no heat coming off the blade and it does not burn its scabbard. Back in the maester's chambers, Sam asks if Maester Aemon can do something to stop Lord Janos from being chosen. The maester is not allowed to show favoritism, and Sam realizes it is up to him.
Sam speaks to Cotter first. Cotter flat-out refuses to support Ser Denys because he feels the old knight is not a fighter and does not find any of the other candidates worth supporting either. Sam is dismayed and takes his leave. He talks to Ser Denys next, though while the knight is far more courteous, he is just as unyielding in his belief that Cotter is not fit to be Lord Commander. He feels the post needs a highborn noble; he was a squire at twelve, a knight at eighteen, a tourney champion at twenty-two, and has commanded the Shadow Tower for thirty-three years. Cotter, on the other hand, needs his maester, Harmune, to read and write his letters for him. This time Sam is ready when he asks if there is anyone else that would serve. Sam then speaks of a man who commanded the respect of Lord Commander Mormont, Donal Noye and Qhorin, was castle raised and trained in the arts of war and diplomacy, and comes from noble blood. He is referring, of course, to Jon. Ser Denys is not entirely convinced due to Jon's age, but Sam sweetens the deal by lying that Stannis means to name Cotter if the Watch has not chosen someone by the end of the day. Sam returns to Cotter and asks if he would support the man Donal entrusted to protect the Wall and was squire to Lord Commander Mormont. Cotter thinks Jon would not be half bad, though he would be better. Sam lies that Stannis means to place Ser Denys in charge if the Watch cannot reach its own decision.","Jon trains with Iron Emmett. He did not sleep the night before as he mulled Stannis' offer and is doing poorly. A particularly hard blow to the head makes him remember once when he and Robb were sparring. They would always announce they were heroes out of stories when they fought. One time, Jon declared he was the Lord of Winterfell, and Robb answered that his mother told him Jon could never be the lord because he was bastard born. The thought gives him renewed fury, and Halder and Hareth have to pull him off Emmett. He stalks off and goes to the bathhouse. He is agonizing over the decision of whether to accept Stannis' offer. He keeps thinking of Catelyn and how she always made sure he felt Winterfell was not his place. Jon hears Ser Alliser and Bowen trying to convince Othell to support Janos. Bowen has the letter Tywin sent stating he wants Lord Janos as the commander of the Watch.1 Jon walks out and does not stop until he passes through to the other side of the Wall. He realizes that he has always wanted Winterfell, hungered for it. Suddenly, his thoughts become more savage, and he realizes they are Ghost's thoughts. Ghost comes out of the woods and bounds towards him. He realizes that Ghost is a creature of the old gods and white as snow. He knows he cannot accept Stannis's offer.
Jon sees Melisandre and Stannis emerge to tend the nightfire, and he goes wide to avoid them. As he walks back inside, he spots Val in her tower window and laments that it is not him who will steal her away. Jon enters the hall, which is in pandemonium. Janos is shouting about turncloaks, Emmett has his sword drawn, Hobb is in a shouting match with a man from the Shadow Tower, and an Eastwatch man is trying to restore order without success. Pyp whistles to silence the hall. Maester Aemon informs Jon that his name has been put forward for Lord Commander. Jon asks who did so and looks to Pyp and Grenn, but Edd announces it was him who did so. Janos says they should hang Jon, but Cotter and Ser Denys speak up that his name was properly put forth. Ser Alliser says they should just vote, but that Othell has something to say first. He withdraws his name. He says he was going to endorse Lord Janos, but now says Jon may be a better choice. The men start chanting for the kettle, and Sam and Clydas bring it forward. As Clydas opens the lid, a large raven flies out. Sam says it is Lord Commander Mormont's raven as it lands next to Jon and says ""snow"" several times. Ser Alliser says it is a trick and that Sam taught many ravens to say ""snow"" and Mormont's raven knew more words. The raven proceeds to ask for corn, settle on Jon's shoulder, and call for the kettle. Jon is elected by an overwhelming margin. Afterwards, over fifty men press around him congratulating or kneeling, including Satin, Owen, Halder, Todder, Spare Boot, Giant, Mully, Ulmer, Donnel, Dywen, Emmett, and Hobb. Bowen expresses support as well, but Cotter and Denys are more cautious and reserved. Jon walks down the hall with Pyp, Grenn, and Sam trailing behind him. Pyp and Grenn are amazed at what Sam accomplished and wonder how he got the raven in the kettle. Sam insists he had nothing to do with it. Jon prepares to face Stannis.","Sansa wakes up in her bedchamber in the Eyrie. She is leading a lonely existence there with only Robert for company. Lysa keeps a small household, and Petyr is hardly ever there, shuttling from one lord to another to assert his authority. Many of the lords of the Vale resent his position as Lord Protector. Yohn Royce is close to open revolt over Lysa's failure to aid Robb, and he has the support of House Waynwood, House Redfort, House Belmore, and House Templeton. To make matters worse, the mountain clans are being particularly troublesome and Lord Eon Hunter died so suddenly that his two younger sons1 are accusing his older son2 of murdering him. Deciding she will not get back to sleep that night, Sansa goes to her window and sees it is snowing. This is the first time she has seen snow since the day she left Winterfell. She remembers how happy she was that day and how she felt her life was truly beginning; in hindsight, it feels her life was ending.
Sansa dresses and goes outside to enjoy the snow. She starts making snowballs, but has no one to use them on so she starts building a castle instead. After awhile, she realizes she is building Winterfell. As she continues building, Lady Lysa, Maester Colemon, and several servants watch her for a time, but none stay for long. She has trouble making the bridges between the keeps, until Petyr appears and tells her to pack the snow around a stick. Sansa is smiling by now, and they finish the castle together. She throws a snowball at him when they are done. Petyr quips it was unchivalrous, and Sansa retorts that so was making her believe she was going home. Petyr leans in to kiss her. Sansa yields for a moment, but is then outraged. As she protests, Robert enters the garden. He sees the castle and decides to have his doll knock it down. Sansa reaches for his arm, but gets his doll instead, ripping the head off. Robert begins to shake violently. Petyr calls for Maester Colemon, who arrives soon after to sedate Robert. Sansa places the doll's head on a stick and mounts it on one of the walls of her castle before stalking off.
Marillion comes late in the afternoon to summon Sansa before Lady Lysa. She tries to dismiss him, but he states Lysa wants him to bring her personally. She wonders why he is acting as a guard, thinking of how Petyr dismissed the Eyrie's captain of the guard3 and replaced him with Lothor Brune. They go to the High Hall, where Sansa thinks she is to be punished for destroying Robert's doll, but Lysa is in a rage over Petyr's kiss and thinks Sansa was responsible. Lysa rages about how Catelyn teased him when they were younger. She mentions a particular time when Catelyn danced with him and then rebuffed his kisses. He drank and passed out afterwards and Lysa went to comfort him. They had sex, and even though Petyr called her ""Cat"" before going to sleep, she stayed with him all night.4 She thinks Sansa is trying to steal him like Catelyn did. She continues to rage about how Petyr was sent away, not because of the duel with Brandon, but because he got Lysa pregnant. Hoster made her have an abortion and told her how lucky she was that a great lord like Jon Arryn would take her soiled, though she knew it was just a bargain to win Hoster's swords to Lord Robert's cause. She promised herself she would never be used that way again and she will not let Sansa take Petyr away from her.
Sansa apologizes for kissing Petyr, which only sends Lysa into a deeper rage. She grabs Sansa by the wrist, drags her to the Moon Door, and makes her look out at the nothingness beyond. She drags Sansa ever closer to the edge as Sansa shrieks, Lysa sobs and rages, and the guards begin pounding on the barred door to the hall. Finally, Petyr comes in through a side door and tries to stop Lysa, but she is delirious with rage and grief now. She screams that she is the only woman who was ever true to Petyr. She got him his first post, and she put the Tears of Lys in Jon's wine at Petyr's request to stop Robert from being fostered at Casterly Rock or Dragonstone. The letter to Catelyn stating that the Lannisters did it was Petyr's idea too. Petyr finally talks her away from the edge and gets her to let go of Sansa. He tells Lysa he has only ever loved one woman, Catelyn, before shoving her out the Moon Door. Marillion looks on in shock and horror as Petyr tells Sansa to let the guards in and tell them Marillion has just killed Lysa.","Merrett Frey trudges up the path to Oldstones. He is bringing gold to ransom Petyr from a group of outlaws. An alcoholic prone to debilitating headaches, he is not well regarded by his family and had to practically beg to win the duty of ransoming Petyr. He hopes bringing Petyr back unharmed will increase his standing. Petyr had wandered off with a camp follower and was captured. Merrett cannot blame Petyr for wanting a woman, as his wife1 is not only twice his age, but she is rumored to be sharing Black Walder's bed as well. Black Walder is known as a man who takes what he wants and has also shared the bed of Edwyn's wife2, his cousin Fair Walda, and, according to rumor, the seventh Lady Frey3 He worries what will happen when Lord Walder dies. For all his faults, Walder has always believed in taking care of his own, and he instilled the same sense of family in his heir, Ser Stevron, but with Stevron dead, his son Ser Ryman, who is thick-witted and greedy, stands to inherit, followed by his sons, Edwyn and Black Walder, who are even worse. Merrett is even more afraid of Lame Lothar, who may be more dangerous than any of them and was the man responsible for planning out the events of the Red Wedding with Roose Bolton. Merrett believes that when Walder dies, there will be civil war amongst his siblings and that most of the Freys will be cast out by the winner.
Merrett fears he does not have the skills or connections to survive on his own when the inevitable strife begins. When he was younger, he had been nearly as big as Ser Hosteen, the strongest of Lord Walder's brood, and had been made a squire by Lord Sumner Crakehall, but during the campaign against the Kingswood Brotherhood, he caught a pox from a whore, was captured by Wenda the White Fawn, and finally, after he was ransomed, was nearly killed by a blow to the head that caused his frequent headaches and ended his dream of knighthood. His luck had only worsened since. He managed a good marriage to a Darry4, but then they lost half their lands and nearly all their wealth and power for supporting House Targaryen during Robert's Rebellion. Worse, his wife gave him only daughters for many years, and his first born, Ami was a slut. After she had been caught with three grooms, he had been forced to marry her to a hedgeknight named Ser Pate, who decided he could win renown by defeating Ser Gregor Clegane and left her a widow. Roose Bolton chose his second daughter, Fat Walda as his bride, but even that did not help because her immense girth meant Lord Walder had to pay out a larger dowry. He even failed in his limited role at the Red Wedding; he was supposed to get the Greatjon to drunk to fight, but he ended up passing out while the Greatjon managed to grab a sword and needed eight men to subdue him, leaving two men wounded, one dead, and Ser Leslyn Haigh short an ear.
Merrett arrives at the appointed spot, and Tom is waiting for him. Suddenly, many additional members of the Brotherhood Without Banners surround him as Lemoncloak asks if he brought the money. Jack-Be-Lucky takes the gold. Notch takes his horse while Lem and Tom take him to the godswood where Petyr is waiting. When they get there, Merrett discovers that Petyr has already been hanged. The outlaws prepare Merrett for hanging. Tom asks him if he knows where Sandor Clegane might be found, the Brotherhood is still looking for him and Arya, but Merrett has no idea where he is. They string Merrett up, and he begins to beg. He says the Red Wedding was not murder; that they had to remove the stain on their honor. He calls it vengeance and states they lost good men too, fifty in the camps as well as Ser Garse Goodbrook and Ser Tytos. Finally, he points out that Lord Beric always gives a trial and that he did nothing. Walder, Ser Ryman, and Roose Bolton came up with the idea, Lame Lothar rigged the tents to collapse, and Walder Rivers led the attack on the camps, but all he did was drink some wine, and the outlaws have no witnesses to say otherwise. Tom says they do have a witness, and to Merrett's horror, Catelyn Stark, who was killed by Raymund, comes forward.5 She cannot speak due to her slit throat, but she nods when Tom asks if Merrett was part of it, and Merrett is hanged."
