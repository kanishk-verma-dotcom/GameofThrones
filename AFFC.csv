"A group of novices and acolytes from the Citadel, Mollander, Alleras, Roone, and Armen, discuss rumors of dragons outside the Quill and Tankard in Oldtown. Pate is with them too, but he is thinking of Rosey, the woman he loves. Her mother, Emma, the oldest serving wench at the Quill and Tankard, has decreed that Rosey's maidenhead will cost him a golden dragon, which he has no hope of ever saving up. His training at the Citadel has not been successful. Now, he helps tend the ravens for Archmaester Walgrave, but the man's wits are completely gone, and Maester Gormon sits below the iron mask in his place and has the power of granting the black iron link for ravenry. Archmaester Ebrose has refused him the silver link for healing, but he still knows enough that he thinks he and Rosey could make a life traveling Westeros to heal the smallfolk. Pate is waiting for a man he calls ""the alchemist."" Rosey introduced Pate to the mysterious man three days ago, and he promised Pate the gold coin he needs to win Rosey in exchange for stealing something. Pate told the man he was not a thief, and the man said he would return to the Quill and Tankard in three days in case Pate changed his mind. He decided to return, but his friends showed up to celebrate Alleras receiving his copper link, so he joined them so as not to draw suspicion.
Mollander, the son of a knight who died on the Blackwater, is convinced the stories of dragons are real. They have heard four different stories from sailors from four different ships, and while the details are different in each one, they all mention dragons and a beautiful young queen. Alleras shoots at apples being thrown by Mollander as they talk. He has only been at the Citadel for a year, yet he has already forged three links of his chain. Pate, on the other hand, arrived at the Citadel five years ago when he was thirteen and still has no links. Twice he felt himself ready to earn one, but Archmaester Vaellyn was not impressed with his knowledge of the heavens, and Archmaester Ebrose refused him a link as well. Alleras ends his target practice and tells the group the dragon must have three heads. Roone thinks this a riddle, which fits with Alleras's nickname as ""the Sphinx."" Lazy Leo had given him the name because a sphinx is made up of the parts of several different animals, and Alleras has a Dornish father and a mother from the Summer Isles.1 Armen scoffs that there are no three-headed dragons, as that was just a heraldric charge for the Targaryens, and they are all dead. Alleras reminds them that Daenerys still lives.
Leo Tyrell joins the group, much to their dismay since he is cruel and none of them like him. He mocks Pate as a pig boy because his namesake is a character from the stories named Spotted Pate that is good-hearted and empty-headed yet always manages to get the best of knights, lords, and septons. The group turns hostile, but Leo deflects them by stating that the rumors do indeed refer to Daenerys and that she has hatched three dragons. Every sailor that has been near Qarth is talking about them, and Archmaester Marwyn believes the stories. Armen says that is no proof because Archmaesters Perestan and Ryam believe Marwyn is unsound. He is said to consort with whores and hedge wizards, speak to Ibbanese and Summer Islanders in their own tongues, and sacrifice to strange gods at the sailors' temples by the docks. He spent eight years exploring the east, looking for lost books and training with warlocks and shadowbinders, and Archmaester Vaellyn dubbed him ""Marwyn the Mage"" upon his return. Leo counters that a glass candle is burning in the maester's chambers. The candles, three black and one green, came to the Citadel a thousand years before the Doom of Vlayria and serve as the final test for an acolyte before he is raised to maester. The acolyte must spend a night in darkness unless he can light the candle, which is made of dragonglass and cannot be lit. The test is meant to teach humility and the limits of knowledge, yet now one of them is casting a light brighter than any wax candle that never flickers. Armen and the others still have doubts save Alleras.
It is getting late, so everyone departs save Leo and Pate, who still hopes the alchemist will appear. Leo cruelly mocks him some more, but Pate ignores the japes because attacking him would mean his death since Leo is trained in arms and his father is Ser Moryn Tyrell, the commander of the City Watch of Oldtown. When dawn breaks, Pate leaves to return to the Citadel. As he walks, the alchemist hails him. He did not come earlier because he did not want to approach Pate while he was with his friends. Pate has stolen a key from Archmaester Walgrave for him, one that opens every door in the Citadel. The alchemist leads him into an alley, where he hands over the gold dragon in exchange for the key. Pate asks who he is and what he wants, but the alchemist just says he is no one. Pate turns to leave, but suddenly finds himself on the ground. He does not understand what is going on, and the alchemist says he never will. Pate dies thinking of Rosey.","Aeron is on Great Wyk drowning initiates into the priesthood of the Drowned God. He has drowned three already without incident, but the fourth and final man, Emmond, thrashes about, and Aeron needs help to finish the job. As he finishes, he sees three men on shore, the Sparr and his son Steffarion and Gormond Goodbrother. He finishes the ceremony with the help of his drowned men, including Norjen and Rus, using CPR to bring Emmond back to life and accepting him into the drowned men. Every priest of the drowned god occasionally loses one of the drowned, even Tarle the Thrice-Drowned, who is so revered he was once chosen to crown a king1, but Aeron has never lost one.
Aeron turns to the new arrivals. Gormond tells him that Balon is dead, killed when the bridge he was crossing at Pyke was destroyed in a storm. Aeron declares that the Storm God cast him down for making the ironmen great again. He takes Gormond's mount and tells his men to meet him at Pebbleton. As he rides, Aeron thinks of his brothers. Their father, Quellon Greyjoy, had nine sons. His first wife, a Stonetree, birthed Harlon, Quenton, and Donel. His second wife, a Sunderly, birthed Balon, Euron, Victarion, Urrigon, and Aeron, and his third wife, who was not of the Iron Islands, birthed a sickly halfwit named Robin. Quenton and Donel died as infants, Harlon was taken by greyscale fever, and only Balon, Euron, Victarion, and Aeron lived to adulthood. Balon had been a fearless child. By thirteen, he was as good with an oar and at the finger dance as any man in the isles. At fifteen, Dagmer Cleftjaw took him reaving in the Stepstones for the first time, and he took his first two salt wives. By seventeen, he captained his own ship.
When Aeron arrives at Hammerhorn, Gran escorts him to the hall, where Lord Gorold awaits with Maester Murenmure. Aeron tells him to send everyone away, but while Gorold sends Gran and two of his daughters, Gysella and Gwin, out of the room, he has the maester stay. Aeron cannot abide maesters and begins to leave until Murenmure informs him that Euron sits the Seastone Chair and calls on all captains to return to Pyke and do fealty. Aeron is shocked that Euron has returned, as Balon exiled him two years ago. He immediately states that only a godly man may sit the Seastone Chair and Euron worships only his pride. Lord Gorold asks if Balon spoke to him of the succession, and Aeron remembers that when he returned from reaving on the Stoney Shore and told Balon of Theon's fate, Balon had stated that he hoped Theon was dead so he could not stand in Asha's way. Before Aeron can speak, however, Murenmure says that Theon is now ruler, or Asha if he is dead, but Aeron cares not for green land law and states that no woman may sit the chair either. Gorold asks what to do, and Aeron says he should send no answer until Aeron has prayed.
Aeron continues on to Pebbleton with Greydon Goodbrother guiding him. As they ride through the night, Aeron dozes in the saddle and thinks of the scream of a rusted hinge and of Urrigon. While Lord Quellon and his elder sons had been away at war, Urrigon, then fourteen, lost half his fingers doing the finger dance with Aeron. Quellon's third wife, a Piper, allowed her maester to attempt sewing the fingers back on his hands, but the wound mortified, and Urrigon died. Quellon died on his voyage as well, and so it was Lord Balon who returned and chopped off three of the maester's fingers and had his father's wife sew them back on. The maester died as his wounds mortified as well, and the wife died not long after while delivering a stillborn daughter. Afterwards, Aeron became a wild drunk until his ship, Golden Storm, was destroyed off Fair Isle by Fury during Greyjoy's Rebellion. He washed up on shore, was taken captive, and spent the rest of the war in chains beneath Casterly Rock. Afterwards, he was a changed man and became a servant of the Drowned God.
Greydon leaves Aeron the next morning to take the news of Balon's death to his cousins at Downdelving, Crow Spike Keep, and Corpse Lake, and Aeron continues to Pebbleton alone, stopping to preach on the way and gathering a dozen followers. By the time he arrives at Pebbleton, his drowned men have prepared a shelter for him, where he retires after drowning his new followers. He is restless, and so wades out into the water and finally figures out what must be done. Lord Meldred Merlyn comes to see him the next morning. He has received a bird from Euron as well as one from Asha at Ten Towers, the seat of House Harlaw. Aeron preaches to the assembled that they should go neither to Pyke nor Ten Towers but rather to the ruins of the Grey King's hall at the hill of Nagga on Old Wyk for a kingsmoot. Urras Ironfoot, Sylas Flatnose, Harrag Hoare, the Old Kraken, and many other great kings had been chosen in kingsmoot, and Aeron believes this is the best way to deny Euron the crown.","Areo Hotah wheels Prince Doran Martell onto the terrace of the Water Gardens, where he watches the children splash in the fountains. After several hours, Obara Sand comes to see him, with Maester Caleotte trailing her and trying to stop her. Areo blocks her entrance, saying Doran does not wish to be disturbed. She asks if Doran knows that Oberyn is dead, and Areo states there was a bird. Obara says that thousands are crossing the Boneway to help Ellaria bring his body home. All over Dorne everyone is asking what Doran will do. Areo reiterates that the prince does not want to be disturbed, but Doran says to let her come forward. Prince Doran has two armies in the field. One, commanded by Lord Anders in the Boneway and the other in the Prince's Pass.1 Obara wants Doran to give her one and Nymeria the other so that Obara can sack Oldtown. Doran says he will think on it, and Obara stalks out angrily.
Caleotte asks if it is prudent to allow Obara to return to Sunspear, and Doran says he must return as well. Caleotte reminds him he will be seen, but Doran says he must attempt to settle the people even if his enemies may learn the extent of his gout. This will be Doran's first visit to Sunspear since departing for the Water Gardens two years ago; his gout was not nearly as bad then, and he could still walk slowly with a cane. Caleotte is especially concerned because Doran will need to grant Myrcella and Arys an audience and Arys reports to the queen. Areo thinks of Arys sadly; he feels the day that they must fight is approaching soon and that when it does, Areo will have to kill him. Doran says they will leave at first light. Doran asks Areo if he had brothers and sisters back in Norvos, and the guard captain responds he had two brothers and three sisters and he was the youngest. Because he was another unwanted mouth to feed and outgrew his clothes quickly, he was sold to the bearded priests. Doran laments that he was the oldest, yet he is the last. Mors and Olyvar both died in the cradle, and when he was nine and a squire at Salt Shore Elia was born a month premature, yet survived. A year later, Oberyn was born. Areo does not know how to respond, as he is a simple man who swore simple vows of ""serve, protect, obey"" when he wed his axe at sixteen. Doran watches the pools until long into the evening when he falls asleep. Areo returns him to his bed, sharpens his axe, and goes to sleep himself.
The next morning, Doran dawdles so that they do not get underway until midmorning. Areo, Caleotte, and twenty guards accompany him. Halfway to Sunspear, Nymeria Sand catches up with the party. She wants leave to take Tyene with her to King's Landing to assassinate Jaime, Cersei, Tywin, and Tommen as revenge for Oberyn, Elia, Aegon, and Rhaenys. Doran says they must wait and that Oberyn was too impatient. He was only supposed to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the throne and make what allies he could, but he could not wait. Nymeria says she does not mean to wait either and gallops off towards Sunspear. When they finally reach Sunspear and make their way to the Old Palace, a throng of people surrounds the litter calling out for vengeance for Oberyn. When they reach the Old Palace, they are greeted by Arianne and half the court, including the seneschal, Ricasso, the castellan, Ser Manfrey Martell, Maester Myles, twenty knights, and Myrcella with her septa, Eglantine, and Ser Arys. Arianne welcomes Doran and tells him Tyene Sand awaits him in the throne room for a private word.
Areo bears Doran to the throne room. Tyene wants Doran to crown Myrcella as the lawful Queen of Westeros, since she is older than Tommen and would inherit by Dornish law, and then bleed the Lannisters when they march south to depose her. Doran says he will think on it. Tyene insults him and then asks for his blessing, which he gives by touching her head, before leaving. When she is gone, Caleotte examines Doran's hand to make sure he was not poisoned and leaves to fetch Doran a small cup of milk of the poppy. When the maester is gone, Doran asks Areo if the guards are loyal, to which Areo responds in the affirmative. Doran orders him to seize all seven of Oberyn's daughters currently in Dorne.2 He would take Sarella too, but she is beyond his reach.3","Cersei's maid, Senelle, wakes her from a nightmare in which Tyrion is laughing at her while the Iron Throne tears her apart. Ser Osmund and Ser Boros are there to tell her that Lord Tywin is dead. Senelle and Jocelyn Swyft help her dress and freshen up a little. Ser Osmund explains that they discovered a passage in Tywin's room and that Jaime has gone to see where it leads. Ser Loras is guarding Tommen. Cersei sends Boros to make sure Tyrion is still in his cell and accompanies Osmund to Tywin's chambers. Cersei is troubled by Tywin's death, but also pleased that she now holds all the power of Casterly Rock and will not be disregarded. As she climbs the Tower of the Hand, she ponders tearing down the cursed structure. Red Lester offers condolences when she reaches the top. The hall is full of people already, and Cersei is irate that she was not told first as the Queen Regent. Ser Meryn guards the entrance to the bedchamber. Tywin has been brought to his bed. Ser Kevan is trying to pray beside it. Cersei is furious that the quarrel is still embedded in his groin and that he has not been bathed and dressed. She wonders if she should weep and if Tywin wept for his own father. Cersei had been one when Lord Tytos died of a burst heart as he was climbing the steps to his mistress, and Tywin had been away in King's Landing at the time serving as Hand. She angrily calls for Grand Maester Pycelle, only to learn that he had already come and then left to summon the silent sisters. She realizes that she was summoned last.
Cersei angrily calls for Ballabar or Frenken, and two guards, Puckens and Shortear, run to obey. They return with Qyburn. He explains that he was once a maester and treated Jaime, and Cersei orders him to remove the quarrel and prepare the body. Qyburn asks what to do with the other body, and Cersei realizes that Shae is in the bed too. Cersei cannot believe that Tywin would use a whore. When Lord Tytos died, Tywin had his mistress paraded naked through the streets to confess herself a thief and a harlot. Qyburn suggests that perhaps Tywin was questioning her about Sansa, and Cersei eagerly accepts the explanation. When she emerges into the hall, Osney and Osfryd have arrived. She tells them to dispose of Shae and make sure no one knows she was there. She tells them to go through the passage just as Jaime emerges. He reports that the passage is blocked by locked iron gates, and he will need keys. Cersei orders men to knock through walls with hammers if they must but to find the killers. She tells Jaime he must be Hand now, but he refuses. Kevan, Qyburn, Osmund, Osfrey, Osney, and three guardsmen, Puckens, Shortear, and Hoke the Horseleg all overhear the rebuff. Jaime mocks her ability to rule, so she slaps him. Kevan angrily tells them to take their quarrel outside. Cersei is sick of meddling Hands and decides that Tywin's successor must be biddable. She therefore plans to ask Kevan. Cersei suddenly wonders where Varys is and thinks he must have been part of it. She orders Ser Meryn to bring him when Ser Boros returns to report Tyrion is gone. One of the gaolers, Rugen, is missing as well, and the guards are asleep. Cersei orders the guards killed. Cersei is suddenly frightened and thinks of a prophecy from her childhood relating to her doom. She closes her eyes and sees Tyrion grinning at her.","Brienne asks several residents of Rosby if they have seen Sansa, asking after her not by name but as a maid of thirteen with blue eyes and auburn hair, but there has been no sign of her. As she prepares to leave, she notices a skinny boy atop a piebald mare, but he vanishes before she can ask after Sansa.1 She leaves the town and continues on towards Duskendale, which she thinks is the most likely place to find Sansa or her trail. The road is full of travelers, but none of them have seen Sansa either. Around dusk, she comes upon two hedge knights grilling trout at a campfire. They invite her over to share the fish and are shocked when she takes off her helm and reveals she is a woman. She asks them about Sansa as well, but they have not seen her. They once again invite her to share their food and introduce themselves as Creighton Longbough and Illifer the Penniless. Ser Creighton offers to escort her to Duskendale, and insists even after she refuses. Illifer tells Creighton to give over and says that a liar like her has no need of them. He points out her shield, which sports the black bat of Lothston, a line that was ended generations ago. The last lord of the line, Lucas Lothston, was known for his dark deeds, as was his son, Manfryd of the Black Hood. By her freakish size, Illifer recognizes her as Brienne of Tarth. He accuses her of killing Renly, which she denies. She thinks of how she fell in love with Renly when he first came to Tarth during his progress when he came of age. Brienne did not want to attend the welcome feast in his honor, sure she would be mocked because of the incident with the rose,2 but Lord Selwyn made her attend. Renly showed her every courtesy and even danced with her; from that day, Brienne wanted nothing more than to serve and protect him. She swears her innocence by the Seven, which satisfies the two hedge knights who ask her to take the first watch. She considers leaving, but does not want to leave the two men defenseless. She is relieved and falls asleep.
The next day, the three travel together. Around midday they encounter a large group of men, women, and children accompanied by a septon and some begging brothers. They are going to King's Landing with a cart full of the bones of servants of the Seven that have been killed during the war and mean to ask for the king's protection. Several of them are armed with axes, clubs, and cudgels, including one big man with the seven-pointed star carved on his breast. The septon, a spare man with a lean sharp face, a short beard grizzled grey and brown, thin hair knotted behind his head, and black gnarled feet, beseeches the hedge knights to join them.3 Ser Illifer offers to escort them to King's Landing for a price, but the septon states that sparrows need no gold. Ser Creighton asks why they call themselves sparrows, and the septon explains they are the humblest of men as the sparrow is the humblest of birds. He goes on to say that it is time for all true knights to gather and defend the Holy Faith. With no payment in the offing, Ser Illifer refuses to accompany the sparrows. Brienne asks after Sansa again, but they have not seen her.
About three hours later, they come across a merchant named Hibald traveling with his serving men and hedge knight guard. Brienne asks after Sansa without success, while Creighton and Illifer offer to travel with the merchant, who accepts. As they ride, the hedge knight drops back to ride with Brienne. He introduces himself as Ser Shadrich of the Shady Glen, also known as the Mad Mouse. He reveals that he recognized Brienne's description of Sansa and that he is also looking for her. He fought for Stannis on the Blackwater and spent all his coin ransoming himself. He means to collect the bounty placed on Sansa by Varys. The party stops for the night at an inn by a bridge called the Old Stone Bridge. Brienne offers to pay for them, as Jaime made sure she had plenty of gold along with a letter signed by Tommen calling on all loyal subjects to assist her. The innkeeper, Naggle, gives them rooms and food. Brienne retires early, drawing Oathkeeper and saying a prayer to the Crone before lying in bed. After all the other patrons have retired for the night, she sneaks out of the inn and continues her journey alone.","Sam is in the library reading various books and folios. He has been there most of the night. One of the last books he read was ''Annals of the Black Centaur'' by Septon Jorquen detailing the nine year term of Orbert Caswell as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He finally gathers up a stack of books and scrolls and emerges from the tunnels beneath Castle Black. The Wall is abuzz with activity as men work to build a new stairway to replace the one destroyed when the wildlings attacked.1 He thinks of the Targaryens that visited the Wall on their dragons two hundred years before, first Queen Alysanne and later King Jaehaerys I, and wonders if Silverwing left an egg at the Wall. Even if she had, he has no clue how Stannis hopes to quicken it when several Targaryens had failed before him.
Dolorous Edd hails Sam and tells him Jon wants to see him. Pyp and Grenn come around the corner as well and tease Sam about missing dinner and not showing up for archery practice with Ulmer. Jon has instituted daily archery drills for the entire garrison; he feels that the Watch pays too much attention to the sword and too little to the bow. This attitude developed when one brother of every ten had been a knight rather than one of every hundred. They tease Sam about Val too, who often watches them from the tower where she is held, until Sam says he has to see Jon. Pyp and Grenn are unhappy with Jon because he never has time for them anymore. What little free time he has is always spent practicing the sword; Jon explained to Sam that he feels he must become worthy of Longclaw. Sam takes his leave.
With the Lord Commander's Tower gutted and Stannis residing in the King's Tower, Jon has taken up residence in Donal Noye's old quarters behind the armory. As Sam approaches, Gilly rushes out of Jon's quarters looking wan and frightened. Sam catches her, dropping two of his books as he does, and tries to talk to her, but she runs off with tears in her eyes, leaving Sam perplexed.2 He inspects the books he dropped, Colloquo Votar's Jade Compendium and Maester Thomax's Dragonkin, Being a History of House Targaryen from Exile to Apotheosis, with a Consideration of the Life and Death of Dragons, and finds that the former is undamaged while the latter now has several muddy pages. He curses himself for his clumsiness and reflects on how Gilly raises certain urges in him that a brother of the Night's Watch should not have.
Hairy Hal and Mully stand guard outside Jon's chambers and tell Sam that the Lord Commander is waiting. As Sam runs through the armory, Ghost watches him pass. As he enters Jon's solar, Lord Commander Mormont's raven flies at him demanding corn. When Sam proffers some from a sack by the door, the crow pecks his hand hard enough to draw blood. Jon shows him a letter written by Maester Aemon addressed to King Tommen. It states that the Watch is not taking sides in the war for the throne and only helps Stannis to defend the realms of men then goes on to ask for aid. Jon does not think it will work. Sam worries that Tywin may march on Stannis and destroy the Night's Watch, while Jon hopes that Stannis can rouse the North and still win. Stannis has sent birds to all the great northern houses asking for support, but so far only the Karstarks have declared for him. Jon signs the letter and tells Sam to make sure it is sent. Sam asks about Gilly, and Jon says Val sent her to plead for Mance's life; rumor is that Stannis means to give him to the flames because Melisandre claims king's blood has the power to wake a dragon. Jon thinks the notion foolish, as Mance was not really a king. Jon also tells Sam that he is sending Gilly and her boy away.
Sam tells Jon a few things he learned in the library. He has found records of four Lord Commanders younger than Jon when they were chosen, including an Osric Stark that was chosen four hundred years ago at the age of ten and served for sixty years. Jon, however, points out that they were all sons, brothers, or bastards of the Kings in the North. Sam was researching the Others as well, but found very little information about them. The oldest histories of Westeros were only written after the Andals came to the continent, as the First Men only left runes on rocks. As such, what little info is known about the Age of Heroes, the Dawn Age, and the Long Night comes from accounts written by septons thousands of years later. These tales of figures such as Brandon the Builder, Symeon Star-Eyes, and the Night's King speak of kings ruling for hundreds of years and knights riding around before any could have existed and are doubtful from a historical perspective. For example, while the Watch traditionally states there have been nine-hundred and ninety-eight commanders of the order, historical records indicate there may have been far fewer. In regards to the Others, Sam read that during the Age of Heroes, the children of the forest would give the Watch one hundred obsidian daggers every year and that the Others come when it is cold and hide from the light of the sun, emerging only at night. Some accounts speak of Others riding dead animals, while still others mention giant ice spiders. Their armor is supposed to be proof against ordinary blades and their swords are so cold they shatter steel, but they do not like fire and are vulnerable to obsidian. Finally, one account of the Long Night speaks of the last hero slaying an Other with a blade of dragonsteel. Jon wonders if this could be Valyrian steel, but while Sam had the same thought as well, he cannot be certain.
Sam says there are still hundreds of books to go through and that he needs more time to find out more, but Jon says he must go to Oldtown with Gilly. Maester Aemon will accompany them as well. Sam points out that Aemon is too old for travel, but Jon responds that if Melisandre needs king's blood for her spells then Aemon is in grave danger. Dareon will also join them at Eastwatch to begin life as a wandering crow. The Blackbird will take them to Braavos, where they shall arrange their own passage to Oldtown. Jon wants Sam to become a maester. Sam is terrified because he wanted to be a maester as a child and Lord Randyll chained him in the dungeon for three days and nights to dissuade him from that thought because a Tarly is not a servant. He tries to explain to Jon, but the lord commander does not care. He orders Sam to go and to no longer call himself craven. Sam delivers Jon's letter for King Tommen to Maester Aemon as instructed and repeats his fears, but Aemon merely states that his own father3 raised similar objections when his grandfather, Daeron II bundled him off to the Citadel, but Daeron knew that too many Targaryen heirs could be as dangerous as too few. Aemon knows his grandfather was right and believes Jon is right to send Sam to the Citadel as well.
The next day, an hour before dawn, Sam joins a guard of a dozen rangers including Black Jack, Kedge Whiteye, and Left Hand Lew in the lichyard. Aemon arrives soon after, escorted by Clydas, followed by Gilly and the baby. Jon arrives with Dolorous Edd to see them off. Aemon tells Jon that he left the Jade Compendium in his chambers for him, a book written by Volantene adventurer Colloquo Votar about his travels in the lands of the Jade Sea, and that he has marked a passage that Jon should find particularly interesting. Gilly, eyes red from crying, tells Jon that he must find a wet nurse for Dalla's baby like he promised and not name him until he is past two years old.2 Jon remembers when he first saw Gilly after Ghost got into her rabbit hutch and laments that it was him she should have feared rather than the direwolf. Sam responds that Gilly has more courage than she knows, and Jon replies that Sam does as well.","Arya watches from the deck of the Titan's Daughter with one of the captain's sons, Denyo, as the light of the Titan of Braavos comes into view. Arya had wanted the captain to take her to Eastwatch, but he refused to do so. The captain has been avoiding her, but some members of the crew have given her gifts such as a silver fork, fingerless gloves, and a floppy woolen hat, while others repeat their names to her over and over until she has them memorized. They all call her Salty since she came on board at Saltpans. The ship passes underneath the Titan of Braavos and enters the lagoon beyond. Captain Ternesio Terys approaches Arya and tells her that his son Yorko will row her ashore. Yorko takes her to the Isle of the Gods and lets her off before the temple to the Many-Faced God. The doors are barred, but when Arya flashes the coin and says ""Valar morghulis,"" they open.
The interior of the temple is dark and full of altars to various gods. At the center is a dark pool, where a man is trying to draw water. Arya sees a stone cup and fills it for the man. Afterwards, she sees he has been stabbed. She realizes that many people in the temple are dead or dying. A girl touches her,1 and Arya spins away. Arya speaks to her, but she does not know the Common Tongue. A tall hooded man comes forward who does.2 Arya tells him about Jaqen and the coin, but he claims not to know Jaqen. He asks who Arya is, and she replies Salty. He knows this is a lie and presses her. She tries several more of the aliases she has gone by in the past, but finally has to reveal her real name, Arya Stark. The man says there is no place for Arya Stark there, but she says she has nowhere else to go. He asks if she fears death and pulls back his hood to reveal a yellowed skull with a grave worm in one socket. He tells Arya to kiss him. Arya is not afraid and does so, even plucking the worm to eat. The worm and the skull vanish to be replaced by a kindly face. The man is shocked that she took the worm, as no one has ever done that before. He asks if she is hungry, and she thinks to herself that she is, but for vengeance.","Cersei and Tommen prepare to pay their final respects to Lord Tywin at the Great Sept. A cold rain is falling, disappointing Tommen, who had wanted to throw pennies to the smallfolk. They ride in a litter escorted by two Kingsguard and fifty Lannister house guards. Few people are out in the streets due to the rain and a general lack of love for Tywin. When the litter arrives at the Great Sept, Ser Meryn helps Cersei down, and the High Septon meets her at the top of the steps. She suddenly remembers that he was hand-picked by Tyrion and worries that he may be an enemy. They enter the Hall of Lamps flanked by Ser Meryn and Ser Osmund. Tywin rests upon a marble bier under the dome of the sept. Jaime is standing vigil over the body. Tywin is decked out in his armor, but his lips are curved in a slight smile, which irks Cersei since he never smiled in life. He is also less fearsome with his eyes closed. Cersei recalls an incident during the feast King Aerys II held for Cersei when she first came to court. Lord Owen was discussing raising the duty on wine, and Lord Renfred Rykker commented that if they needed gold, they should sit Lord Tywin on a chamber pot. Aerys and the others laughed; all Tywin did was stare at Renfred, who was routed from the room. She thinks that Tywin was a great man, but that she will be even greater. Tommen notices that Tywin smells of decay.
Seven septons beseech the Father to judge Tywin justly, after which seventy-seven septas sing to the Mother for her mercy. Attendees at the ceremony include Ser Kevan, Lancel, looking grey-faced and gaunt with hollow cheeks, sunken eyes, and brittle white hair, Lord Gyles, Grand Maester Pycelle, Lord Mace, Lady Alerie, Lady Olenna, Lord Garlan, and Margaery. After the ceremony, Cersei accepts condolences from several of the assembled. Ser Horas and Ser Hobber kiss her hand, Lord Paxter kisses her cheek, Hallyne tells her a flaming hand will burn in the sky when Tywin's bones go west, Lord Gyles tells her he has hired a master stonecarver to make a statue of Lord Tywin to stand at the Lion Gate, and Ser Lambert Turnberry appears with a patch over his right eye and swears he will wear it until Tyrion is brought to justice. Lady Falyse and her husband, Ser Balman, approach next and send Lady Tanda's regrets; Lollys is near her time and Tanda felt she should stay with her. Tanda wants permission to name the child Tywin if it is a boy, which Cersei furiously refuses since the child is a bastard.
Cersei reminds Kevan of their meeting later and talks to Lancel. He is unhappy about taking up residence at Castle Darry, which is currently full of outlaws, and marrying his Frey wife. He says the High Septon prayed for him when he was near death and told him that the Mother had spared him for some holy purpose as atonement for his sins. Cersei wonders what he might have told the High Septon about bedding her. Cersei next braves the Tyrell host, receiving condolences from Margaery, Lady Alerie, Meg, Alla, and Elinor. Lady Alyce asks for leave to name her soon-to-be-born child Tywin if a boy or Lanna if a girl, and Cersei gives her consent. Lady Taena tells Cersei that she has sent word to her friends in the Free Cities to seize Tyrion if he can be found and tells Cersei she only wants to serve the queen. Cersei tells her they will have to speak again later. Lord Mace offers both condolences and thinly veiled requests to be named Hand of the King. He also mentions that his uncle Garth has agreed to serve as master of coin as he and Tywin had agreed and is on his way to Oldtown to take ship for King's Landing. Cersei is not pleased at the thought of another Tyrell on the small council and lies that Lord Gyles has already agreed to serve in that capacity. Lord Mace is angry and insulted, but there is little he can do. Lady Olenna appears and makes some snide comments about Cersei and the stink of Tywin's corpse before leading Mace away flanked by Erryk and Arryk.
Cersei gathers up Tommen and departs. She allows Tommen to ride back to the Red Keep and invites Lord Gyles to ride in her litter. He accepts the position of master of coin and talks of several officials that he would like to replace that were on Lord Petyr's payroll. Cersei says that if the issue comes up, he was appointed the day before. When she arrives back at the castle, Cersei retires to her chambers but only gets a moment's rest before Jocelyn announces that Qyburn is there to see her. Senelle attends them. Qyburn has been investigating Tyrion's disappearance. The same night he escaped, Varys vanished as did a jailor named Rugen.1 Rugen was the undergaoler in charge of the black cells and received that appointment from Aerys II. He kept to himself and came and went as he pleased. Rugen's chambers had been thoroughly examined by Jaime and the city watch, but Qyburn found a secret compartment in the floor under the chamberpot which contained a single gold coin bearing the likeness of Garth XII Gardener, king of the Reach.2 Qyburn has also examined Gregor. He believes manticore venom was the poison used, but it has been thickened somehow so as to take a long time to kill. Qyburn thinks a spell is responsible, but Cersei scoffs at the notion. Whatever the cause, Gregor is dying slowly and painfully, and nothing can be done to save him. Qyburn asks permission to study Gregor further so he may discover what dark art was used to make the poison. Cersei asks Qyburn why the Citadel took his chain away, and he explains that he aspired to be the greatest healer the Citadel had ever known. While the maesters have always opened the bodies of the dead to understand the nature of life, Qyburn began opening the bodies of the living to understand death and was stripped of his chain and banished. Cersei gives Gregor over to Qyburn's care, but tells him to remove Gregor to the black cells and bring her his head when he finally dies. Cersei dismisses Qyburn with a final warning to keep his work secret.
Ser Kevan arrives at sunset for supper. Afterwards, Cersei broaches the subject of naming him Hand, but he is reluctant. He says he will serve, but only if Cersei names him regent as well and returns to Casterly Rock. Cersei is aghast at this idea, but Kevan reminds her that Tywin meant to send her back to the Rock himself. He says that the kingdom is in ruins and that Tywin was needed to set things right. Cersei says she will do so, but Kevan is contemptuous of her abilities and mocks her capability as a mother as well. Cersei throws her wine in his face, and he asks leave to withdraw. Cersei says he has no place to offer her terms, and Kevan reminds her that while he holds no lands, both Tytos and Tywin looked after him and his financial well-being. He keeps two hundred knights in his service, a number he can easily double while also hiring freeriders and sellswords. Ser Kevan says that if Cersei will not name him regent, she should name him castellan of the Rock and name either Lord Randyll or Lord Mathis as Hand. Cersei thinks he has been bought by the Tyrells, but Kevan points out that naming either of them would put them in her debt and remove them from Lord Mace's side. Ser Kevan says he will go home. Cersei states that Tommen needs him, but Kevan retorts that he already has his mother, and his father as well.","Jaime stands vigil over Tywin's body as the last of the mourners leave the Great Sept. Ser Balon and Ser Loras remain. They implore Jaime to rest and let one of them take a watch over the body, but Jaime insists he will stand the full seven days and nights. He feels incredible guilt for releasing Tyrion and blames himself for Tywin's death. He dismisses the other two Kingsguard and thinks back to the night Tyrion escaped. He had waited in Varys's chambers for the eunuch to return and placed a dagger at his throat, threatening to kill him if he did not help. He never imagined that Tyrion would kill their father. Jaime has been looking for Varys, but he has not reappeared. He led a dozen guards into the secret passages of the Red Keep, but their search yielded nothing save darkness and dragon skulls. As he gazed at those skulls, he remembered the day Rhaegar had ridden out from King's Landing to meet Robert in battle. Jaime had pleaded with Rhaegar to go with him, but Rhaegar told him that Aerys feared Tywin more than Robert and wanted Jaime close so Tywin could not harm him. He also said that he would call a council when the battle was over, and that he had meant to do so long ago.
That morning, a thousand lords and ladies had passed by the bier to pay their respects, and several thousand smallfolk did the same in the afternoon. Jaime believes most of them were secretly happy that Tywin was gone, but Grand Maester Pycelle was visibly distraught. He told the story of how the grey plague struck Oldtown when he was a boy and killed half the people in the city and three-quarters of the Citadel. The lord at the time, Quenton Hightower, responded by burning every ship in port, closing the gates, and ordering the guards to slay any who tried to flee. The people hated him for it, and on the day he reopened the port they dragged him from his horse, slit his throat, and killed his young son as well, but Pycelle respects that he did what needed to be done to save the city. He admired Tywin for the same reason.
Jaime's thoughts turn to Cersei. She suspects half the court of being traitorous, even Ser Ilyn Payne, since as King's Justice he has command of the dungeons. As he cannot speak, he leaves the actual running to his underlings. Jaime questioned one of them himself, the chief undergaoler, Rennifer Longwaters. He was disgusted to learn that Cersei had ordered the two turnkeys on duty to be killed before they were even questioned. He berated Ser Boros and Ser Osmund for it later. Half-delirious through lack of sleep, Jaime's thoughts wander as he ponders Tyrion and his claim that Cersei slept with Lancel and Osmund, before his thoughts turn to Brienne. As a large group of septons, septas, and brothers file in for evening devotions, Jaime thinks back to his vigil before he was knighted by Ser Arthur Dayne. Some time after the devotions are over, a woman enters clothed in roughspun. Jaime realizes it is Cersei. She tells him of Kevan's refusal and that he knows about their relationship. She begs Jaime to be Hand, but he refuses again. Cersei leaves angrily, saying she was a fool to ever love him.
The next morning, Tywin is visibly rotting and exudes a horrid stench. The mourners file in again, led by Lord Mace and Queen Margaery, while Cersei and Tommen arrive last guarded by Ser Osmund. When they approach, the smell makes Tommen cry and retch, and he flees the chamber. Jaime goes after him to give him some advice, but Cersei arrives soon after and scolds him in a fury. Lord Mace comes out soon after, and Jaime tells him he should sup with Cersei. Afterwards, Cersei rounds on him furiously, but he tells her that they must get Mace out of the city and that she should send him to capture Storm's End. Cersei points out that he will not leave until Margaery weds Tommen, and Jaime says they should give him his wedding since they cannot consummate for years anyway and the marriage can be set aside. Cersei finally agrees.","Brienne arrives at the gates of Duskendale and queues up to wait for the gates to open at dawn. As she waits, she asks others assembled outside the gate if they have seen Sansa without success. As dawn breaks, she looks around her at the people waiting to enter. Most are farmers, but there is also a pair of wealthy townsmen and a skinny boy on a piebald horse.1 At the gate, the guards bar her way at first, but let her pass when they see she is a woman. She remarks that she means to repaint her shield, and one of the guards tells her that his sister does such work. In the market square just inside the gate, hawkers are selling leftover arms and armor from the battle between the Northmen and Randyll Tarly for cheap prices. Brienne rides to the house of the guardsman's sister and gives her the shield for repainting. The woman does not like the site of the black bat of Lothston, as her mother used to tell her that Mad Danelle sent giant bats out of Harrenhal on moonless nights to carry back children for her cooking pot. When asked what it should be replaced with, Brienne describes a design recalled from her father's armory,2 as she dare not carry her own arms while people still believe she killed Renly. The woman agrees to do the job, but it will not be done until the next day and she suggests Brienne take a room at the Seven Swords across the street, named for the seven members of House Darklyn that served in the Kingsguard, more than any other house in the realm.
After securing a room, Brienne takes a bath. She asks the bath maid if any Darklyns remain in Duskendale and learns that while there are many Darkes, Darkwoods, and Dargoods around, all the lordly Darklyns are gone. Lord Denys was the last of the line, which had ruled as kings from Duskendale before the coming of the Andals. After her bath, Brienne walks to the Dun Fort to inquire after the lord of the town. The guard informs her that Lord Renfred is at Maidenpool with Lord Randyll and that Ser Rufus Leek serves as castellan in his absence. Brienne is brought before Ser Rufus and presents her warrant from Tommen. Rufus cannot read and sends her to his maester. The maester is annoyed, as many have come looking after Dontos since his house is from Duskendale. The Hollards were once of high blood, and three served as queens to Darklyn kings. Even after the kingdom was absorbed into a larger, Hollard continued to serve Darklyn until the Defiance of Duskendale. Brienne knows only a little of the defiance, which her own maester told her was the event that drove King Aerys II mad, so the maester tells the tale.
Lord Denys had taken a Myrish woman, Serala, as his wife, who gained the name the Lace Serpent for the poisons she supposedly whispered in his ear. She is blamed for planting the idea in Lord Denys's head to kidnap King Aerys. The lord's master-at-arms, Symon Hollard, led the party that took the king and killed Ser Gwayne Gaunt in the taking. For half a year, Lord Denys held Aerys in Duskendale as Lord Tywin Lannister encamped an army outside but dared not attack because Denys threatened to kill the king. In the end, Ser Barristan Selmy managed to enter the town and rescue the king, after which Lord Denys opened his gates and begged for mercy. Instead, Aerys executed him as well as all his brothers, his sister, his uncles, and his cousins to extinguish the line. Lady Serala was burned alive. As for the Hollards, Ser Jon Hollard served as Lord Denys's steward and was married to his sister, so he and his young son died with her. Robin Hollard, a squire, had taunted Aerys and pulled his beard during his captivity and died on the rack. Ser Symon was slain by Ser Barristan during the rescue of the king. The house lands were taken, their castle pulled down, and their villages put to the torch. Dontos, the son of Symon's twin brother, Ser Steffon, who had died of a fever several years before, would have been slain too, but he had taken no part in the defiance and Ser Barristan asked that his life be spared. Dontos was therefore made a squire and never returned to Duskendale. The maester sees no reason why he would return now and suggests that Brienne should look for him elsewhere.
On her way back to the castle, Brienne is dejected at her failure. She thinks that Sansa would not have fled to strangers and would flee to someplace she knew. She thinks back to her interrogation of Brella in King's Landing, who now serves as a washerwoman at a brothel because no noble will hire a servant that served two traitors. Brella told her that Sansa often prayed in the godswood and that she probably returned to the North where her gods are. Brienne cannot begin to guess which Stark bannerman she may have run to and wonders if she would have fled to relatives instead. She thinks this could mean the Wall, Riverrun, or the Vale, but cannot decide which one. As she ponders, she gets lost and takes a wrong turn. She starts back the way she came and collides with a boy. The boy, who looks familiar to Brienne, mutters an apology and runs off. Brienne realizes it is the boy she saw at the gate that morning.
The inn is crowded when she returns, but a dwarf holy brother gives up his seat for her. The dwarf's hair is tonsured, which Septa Roelle once told her is a style some holy brothers adopt to show they have nothing to hide from the Father. The dwarf had served at a holy house near Maidenpool until it was burned by Northmen and then further ransacked by sellswords, who killed everyone but him because he was able to squeeze inside a log to hide. Brienne mentions the brothers she saw headed for King's Landing, and the dwarf reveals that hundreds of brothers, septons, and smallfolk, which he names sparrows, are on there way to the city. Brienne asks the dwarf if he has seen Sansa or Dontos, and the brother reveals he saw a fool in Maidenpool.3 He says the man was in an establishment called the Stinking Goose looking for passage for three across the Narrow Sea. Brienne wonders if the third could be Tyrion.4 A few days later, a man named Nimble Dick was in the same establishment boasting that he had ""fooled a fool."" Brienne buys the dwarf dinner and ponders what he told her. She is leery of going to Maidenpool with Lord Randyll there, but decides it is the best course of action.
That night, she dreams of Renly's death, but his face becomes that of Jaime. The next morning, the guardsman's sister comes bearing the repainted shield, which includes a tree and a falling star.1 As she leaves town, she sees the common grave where the Northmen who attacked Duskendale were buried and says a silent prayer for Robb and Catelyn and swears she will find Catelyn's daughters. More than an hour outside of town, Brienne comes to a fork in the road and the ruins of a castle. The right-hand fork leads to Crackclaw Point, while the left-hand fork is the road to Maidenpool. Seeing three merlons crowned with yellow sandstone, Brienne realizes the ruined castle once belonged to House Hollard. As a storm is developing, she decides to take refuge in the ruin. As she begins searching for wood for a fire, she hears a rider approach. She can tell the rider is a small man, and fears it is Ser Shadrich. She hopes that if it comes to a fight, Shadrich will underestimate her because she is a woman just as Lord Grandison's castellan had. She had been sixteen when betrothed to Ser Humfrey Wagstaff, a sixty-five year old knight who vowed she would act a lady when they wed or he would chastise her. Brienne had responded that she would only accept chastisement from a man who could beat her in the yard, and she broke Ser Humfrey's collarbone and two ribs in the subsequent sparring match. That was the end of their betrothal, the third that had fallen through. After that, her father no longer tried to arrange a marriage for her. Her master-at-arms, Ser Goodwin, always used to tell her that men would want to best her quickly for pride's sake, and her best strategy was to conserve her strength as they spent theirs before striking.
Brienne is surprised when the rider turns out not to be Shadrich, but a boy instead, specifically the boy she bumped into at Duskendale. As he turns down a road, she realizes he was at Rosby as well and must be following her. He passes by the castle, so she decides to ambush him by sneaking up behind him to give his horse a whack with her tourney sword. The boy falls and lands in the mud. He manages to stutter out that his name is Podrick Payne. Brienne feels sympathy for him and remembers the day Ser Ronnet Connington had come to see her at Evenfall when she was twelve and he eighteen. He was bringing her a rose and all she had to do was welcome him to the castle, but she was so nervous she could not get the words out. Brienne demands to know why Podrick is following her, and he explains it is because Brella told him she was looking for Sansa. He figures Sansa will lead him to Tyrion. He still considers himself Tyrion's squire and is dejected that he was left behind.","Sansa and the rest of the Eyrie are plagued by Marillion's constant singing in the sky cells. Sansa asks Lord Petyr to make him stop, but Littlefinger says he promised the singer that he could sing. It will be over soon, however, as Lord Nestor is coming to make inquiries into Lady Lysa's demise. Marillion has agreed to confess before the lord. Sansa is afraid that Marillion may tell the truth, but Petyr says it will not matter because it would be their word against his, and Petyr has prepared an incentive for Lord Nestor to side with him. Sansa will have to tell her side of the story too, which frightens her, but Petyr says the lie is necessary to save them. She already lied to Lord Robert about what happened, but that was different because he was a little boy that had to be protected from the truth for his own sake. Sansa does not fully trust Petyr, but is willing to go along for the moment as he did save her life. Petyr's devious, lying side worries her, but everyone else she cares about is dead so far as she knows and she is isolated and friendless save for him. That night, she is unable to sleep for long due to Marillion's continued singing.
Lord Nestor arrives late in the afternoon with his son, Ser Albar, a dozen knights, and twenty men-at-arms. Lord Petyr, Sansa, and Maester Colemon greet him. After the introductions are over, Petyr sends Sansa to fetch Robert. She finds him in his chambers being dressed by two serving women, Gretchel and Maddy. He has been crying and is a mess. Sansa orders a washbasin brought for Robert, whom she addresses as Sweetrobin. Robert did not sleep well the night before because of the singing and because his door was locked. Sansa actually ordered Lothor to lock the door because Robert has taken to sleeping with her, often nuzzling her breasts or wetting the bed. Sansa and Maddy take Lord Robert to the great hall, where he receives Lord Nestor. Nestor asks after Lysa, and Robert says Marillion killed her. Ser Marwyn Belmore, Lysa's captain of the guard before Petyr replaced him with Lothor, asks Robert if he saw the deed himself, and the boy responds that Petyr and Alayne did. Sansa recounts the tale. Part way through, Robert begins shaking violently while demanding to make Marillion fly, and Lothor is forced to restrain him. When the episode is over, Lothor and Colemon remove Robert from the hall. Lord Nestor accepts the story, particularly since Marillion made many enemies by mocking various nobles and then running to Lysa for protection who showered him with gifts. Mord escorts Marillion, now blind, into the hall, who confesses to the murder. He says that he killed her out of jealous love when he learned she was pregnant with Petyr's child. Mord leads him back out, and Sansa is astonished to see the jailor has gold teeth.1 Petyr offers rooms and refreshments for his guests and has Oswell lead Lord Nestor's retainers away while he asks Lord Nestor to attend him in private.
Sansa serves Lords Petyr and Nestor in the solar. Nestor informs Petyr that Lord Yohn is on his way to question Marillion and that he will be coming in force with a group including Ser Symond Templeton, Lady Anya Waynwood, Lord Benedar Belmore, Lord Gilwood Hunter, Lord Horton Redfort, Ser Samwell Stone, Lord Uthor Tollett, Ser Damon Shett, Lord Royce Coldwater, and Ser Lyn Corbray. Lord Yohn means to remove Petyr as Lord Protector. Nestor wonders what Petyr will do, and Petyr presents him a decree naming Nestor's branch of House Royce Keepers of the Gates of the Moon in perpetuity. Petyr signed the decree himself, claiming that Lysa was murdered before she could do so. Lord Nestor calls this a bold move that will make some unhappy. The Gates were raised by House Arryn as a summer seat when its members still wore the Falcon Crown and ruled as kings of the Vale, and it remains an Arryn possession. Lord Jon served as Keeper of the Gates when his father was lord, and Jon's brother Ronnel and cousin Denys later both served in that capacity as well. Lord Nestor has long coveted the castle, however, as he fells he deserves it as a reward for ruling the Vale while Lord Jon served as Hand.
Much later, after Lord Nestor takes his leave, Petyr asks Sansa if she realizes what he did. She says that he gave Nestor the Gates of the Moon in return for his support. Petyr admits it, stating that if he had tried to bribe Nestor outright he would be rebuffed, but that he wanted to be a lord in truth and bequeath something to his son. Sansa realizes that Petyr signed it himself instead of having Robert sign so that if he dies, Nestor's claim will be called into question. Petyr is pleased that she sees the ploy and compliments her as his daughter. She protests, but Petyr says she must think of herself as his daughter in her heart or the deception could fail. Sansa is not sure she wants to go that far, but realizes that this is what Petyr wants and lies that she will. That night, Robert comes to her bed to sleep. He asks if Sansa is his mother now, and she replies that she is, figuring that the lie is kindly meant and therefore of no harm.","Asha sits in the great hall of Ten Towers looking over the assembled captains and crews celebrating. She is disheartened that so few have come. Each lord has hung his banner in the hall, and only Botley, Stonetree, Volmark, and Myre are represented along with the personal sigils of several Harlaws, Sigfryd, Hotho, Boremund, and Ser Harras. Asha notes that her uncle, Lord Rodrik Harlaw, is not present and asks the steward, Three-Tooth, if he has gone to his books. Three-Tooth answers in the affirmative and that Lord Tristifer Botley is with him. Asha wonders why Tristifer is lord instead of Lord Sawane's eldest son, Harren, and is uncomfortable at the thought of speaking to him. Asha next asks after her mother, who Three-Tooth informs her is abed in the Widow's Tower, so named because Rodrik's sister Gwynesse moved in to mourn after her husband was lost off Fair Isle during Greyjoy's Rebellion and has been there ever since, always complaining that Ten Towers should be hers because she is seven years older than Rodrik. Asha's mother, Alannys, is frail and sickly and will probably not last much longer. The last time Asha saw her was before she left for the campaign in the North, and she had been heartbroken when Asha arrived without Theon. She dreads having to tell her mother that he is dead. Asha tells Three-Tooth to see to her captives, Sybelle Glover and her children, Gawen and Erena. Erena is sick, and Asha warns Three-Tooth to make sure the baby is cared for and does not die.
Asha is pleased to be back at Ten Towers, which always felt more like home than Pyke. It is the newest castle in the Iron Islands, raised by Lord Rodrik's grandfather, Theomore Harlaw, after three of his sons died in infancy, which Lord Theomore blamed on the flooded cellars, damp stones, and festering nitre of Harlaw Hall. The same changeable nature that led the lord to have six wives also led the design to change over time, making it appear like ten castles squashed together. The thickest tower is the Book Tower, which Asha climbs to see her uncle, Lord Rodrik, who is reading. He is almost never found without a book, even on the deck of his longship, Sea Song, and while pronouncing judgments in the great hall. At the moment, he is reading Archmaester Marwyn's Book of Lost Books, in which the author claims to have found three pages of Signs and Portents, a book of visions written down by the daughter of Aenar Targaryen before the Doom of Valyria.
Rodrik is pleased Asha has finally arrived, as she had been expected earlier. Asha explains she was delayed because the winds were against them and because Lady Sybelle's milk dried up on the voyage and she needed to find a wet nurse. Her men could only find a goat instead, and this is why the baby is not doing well. Rodrik informs her that she is come too late. Asha idly turns the pages of the nearest book, an account of King Maegor's war against the Poor Fellows, as they talk of family. Asha is convinced Balon was murdered, and Rodrik agrees that the timing of Euron's return cannot be a coincidence. Asha asks where all the ironmen are, as she means to drive Euron from the Seastone Chair. Rodrik tells her that Harlaw, Stonetree, and Volmark have gathered along with some Myres. These are all Harlaw houses, and Asha wonders where the houses of the other islands are. Rodrik says that Lord Baelor Blacktyde came to consult him and then sailed for Old Wyk. Asha is confused, and Rodrik reveals that Aeron called a kingsmoot. Asha is amused at first, but Rodrik says that other priests such as Blind Beron Blacktyde, Tarle the Thrice-Drowned, and the Old Grey Gull have taken up Aeron's call, and the captains are gathering at Old Wyk. Rodrik is worried, because according to Haereg's History of the Ironborn, the last kingsmoot ended with Urron of Orkmont letting axemen loose among the attendees, after which House Greyiron held the throne unopposed for one thousand years until the Andals arrived. There has not been a kingsmoot in four thousand years according to Haereg's account, although Maester Denestan argued in Questions that these events happened only two thousand years ago.
Rodrik feels the kingsmoot is a terrible idea, as he has always felt that talk of kings is folly and the old way is dead. He feels that the ironmen should side with one of the warring kings in exchange for new lands. Asha feels she must go to claim the throne, but Rodrik argues that she will never be elected because she is a woman. Asha will not be deterred because as long as Rodrik supports her, she will have Harlaw, which is the richest and most populous of the iron islands. Rodrik counters that all captains are equal in the kingsmoot, and he cannot order them to support her claim. He entreats her to think of her mother, who spent her final years on Pyke wandering the castle at night looking for her dead sons. Rodrik asks after Theon. Asha says he must be dead, but that Winterfell was a mess when she arrived after the sack and it was impossible to identify all the body parts in the castle. In a final attempt to dissuade her from attending the kingsmoot, Rodrik says that if she stays he will name her his heir to Ten Towers since both his sons died off Fair Isle and he is unlikely to have any more. Asha believes that his cousins would never allow it, as Boremund has three sons to think of, Sigfryd has grandsons, and Hotho has ambitions and they all mean to follow Rodrik. Rodrik counters that Ser Harras will rule Harlaw after him, but Asha can have the castle. Asha turns him down and leaves.
Out in the yard, Asha is stopped by Tristifer. She asks if it is true that he is now Lord Botley, and he explains that his elder brother was killed by crannogmen at Moat Cailin, making him the heir, but that he is lord in name only since Euron dispossessed him of his lands. Half were given to Waldon Wynch, the first lord to swear fealty to Euron, while the other half are now ruled by Tristifer's uncle, Germund. Euron bought both men with a portion of a vast hoard of treasure he brought with him. Asha promises to restore Tristifer's lands when she is queen, but he cares for naught but her. He had been fostered at Pyke along with four other boys after Maron and Rodrik died to replace the children lost to war and soon took a fancy to Asha. She returned his favor at first, but began to lose interest when he began to speak of how many children she would bear him, since she wanted to be a warrior. Soon after, Maester Qalen discovered them together, and Tristifer was sent away to foster with Lord Baelor Blacktyde. He had tried to write her, but Maester Joseran refused to send the letters. Tristifer professes his continuing adoration, which bothers Asha since she no longer has any feelings for him. She asks if he will speak for her at the kingsmoot, and he responds that while he will, he sees the idea as folly. He believes that Euron means to come to power through blood and treachery and that he has gathered many captains, including Alyn Orkwood of Orkmont, Pinchface Jon Myre, Left-Hand Lucas Codd, Harren Half-Hoare, the Red Oarsman, Kemmet Pyke the Bastard, Rodrik Freeborn, and Torwold Browntooth. She points out that they are men of small account and not important. Tristifer says he will go with her and be his wife as well, as her mother has already given her consent. Asha says he does not really want her, but he claims he loves her and needs her and they were meant to be together. She tells him she has had many men, which shocks him but does not weaken his resolve. He finally grabs her arm, causing her to put her dirk to his throat. She reminds him she is his queen not his wife and stalks away.","Jocelyn dresses Cersei for Tommen's wedding. Cersei is furious that she has to go through with the ceremony, but Tommen is not yet secure enough on his throne that she can offend Highgarden. She orders eggs for breakfast, but after breaking the first and discovering it contains a half-formed chick, she has Senelle bring wine instead. Jaime arrives and informs her of the security precautions that will be in place at the wedding. Men will watch as every dish is prepared and goldcloaks will escort the dishes to the hall. Ser Boros will taste every dish, and Maester Ballabar will be there with purges and antidotes for twenty common poisons. Cersei is still worried for Tommen's safety and thinks back to being in a tent with a girl named Melara, now long dead, as an old hag makes threats. She fears that Tyrion may be waiting in the walls for an opportunity to slit Tommen's throat. She orders Jaime to stay in his room all night long over his protests. He will be sharing a bed with Margaery that night. Lady Olenna and Lady Alerie both wanted them to share a bed from that point forward, but Cersei would only consent to the one night. Cersei tells Jaime she wants eyes in the room that night and Jaime wonders why, as Tommen is far too young to conceive. Cersei retorts that Lord Ossifer Plumm was ""much too dead,"" but that did not stop him fathering a child, which just leaves Jaime confused.1
Jaime asks if she still means to burn the Tower of the Hand, and Cersei replies she will after the feast. She hopes that the fire will smoke out Tyrion, Varys, and Rugen, which Jaime thinks is ridiculous. He had men exploring the tower bit by bit knocking down walls and ripping up floors, and while they found fifty or so passages, there has been no sign of any people. Some passages were so small that stableboys had to be used to explore them. One got stuck and had to be pulled out shrieking while another fell and broke his legs. Two guardsmen also disappeared while exploring a side tunnel. Cersei wants to build a new palace beyond the river after the war is over. Jamie compares her use of wildfire to burn the tower akin to something Aerys might do, and Cersei thinks to herself that Jaime is a stranger to her now and wonders why she ever loved him.
The wedding ceremony is a small gathering compared to Joffrey's, with fewer than a hundred guests looking on in the sept of the Red Keep. As Tommen and Margaery exchange vows, Cersei looks over at Lord Mace, Lady Alerie, and Lady Olenna and thinks of getting revenge for this travesty of a wedding. Afterwards, many of the guests offer congratulations, including Ser Lyle, Lord Gyles, Lord Paxter, Lord Mace, and Grand Maester Pycelle. Ser Kevan is among the last to come forward. He is leaving after the wedding for Castle Darry. Ser Harwyn has cleared the outlaws out of the castle and Lancel's bride, Amerei, waits for him there. The area is still not safe, however, as the remnants of the Brave Companions are still loose, and Lord Beric is hanging Freys. Kevan asks if the rumors about Sandor joining Beric are true. Cersei is surprised he heard about that and tells him that reports claim that he led a raid on Saltpans, killing a dozen men and raping a girl of twelve.2 Cersei tells Kevan that he is just the person to deal with Sandor. She has named Damion castellan of the Rock and Daven as Warden of the West to snub Kevan. Kevan stalks away, and Jaime escorts Cersei to the small hall for the wedding feast.
Cersei is cross at the Tyrells and Olenna in particular, but Jaime reassures her that Olenna is leaving the next day. Lord Mace is taking half his strength to besiege Storm's End, while the other half joins Garlan to make good his claim to Brightwater Keep. When Cersei enters the hall, Margaery embraces her. Cersei hates the girl for not mourning Joffrey and wedding Tommen so quickly and thinks she only wants the crown. She has to restrain herself from slapping Margaery. The feast is only a modest seven courses. Moon Boy and Butterbumps entertain while musicians play. Only one singer is present this time, a favorite of Margaery's called Wat the Blue Bard. Cersei looks at Olenna and thinks back to Maggy the Frog and her tent. The crone had sucked blood from Cersei's finger and prophesied that she would be queen until another comes, younger and more beautiful, to cast her down. Cersei worries it could be Margaery. Jaime is nervous during the dinner despite the fact that Ser Osmund and Ser Meryn are guarding the doors, Ser Balon stands beside Tommen, and Ser Loras stands by Margaery. At one point, Tommen begins to cough, scaring Cersei, but he was just choking on some wine. Cersei retreats from the hall and begins to weep.
Lady Taena follows Cersei out of the hall and offers the queen comfort. She also brings news that Senelle is a Tyrell spy and reports to Alla, Elinor, and Megga for Margaery. Cersei says Taena will be rewarded and returns to the hall. Jaime tries to comfort her when she returns, but she is not assuaged. She looks over the assembled, including Lord Mace, Lord Paxter, Lord Mathis, Kevan, Lancel, Pycelle, and Senelle, who is serving, and thinks that she has no one she can rely on and needs to surround Tommen with her own people. Tommen dances with his new wife as well as Alla, Elinor, and Megga. Jaime asks Cersei for a dance as well, but she refuses and insults him. She watches the Tyrell girls as Margaery dances with Alla, Megga dances with Ser Tallad, and Elinor shares a cup of wine with Aurane Waters. As Tommen returns to his seat, Cersei sees Kevan talking to Garlan and wonders if they are plotting together. Cersei announces that it is time to go outside and light the Tower of the Hand. At a signal from Hallyne, a group of archers launch flaming arrows at the tower, which ignites the wildfire already placed within. As the tower burns, Cersei thinks back on all the Hands she knew, Owen Merryweather, Jon Connington, Qarlton Chelsted, Jon Arryn, Eddard Stark, Tyrion, and Tywin and thinks that they are all gone now with their scheming and betrayals and that she now rules the kingdom. Lady Olenna, flanked by Erryk and Arryk says it is time for the king and queen to go to bed. Jaime asks if Cersei will retire as well, but she wants to watch the tower burn.","Ser Arys walks through the streets of Sunspear in disguise. He does not want to be recognized because a fortnight ago the mob killed a trader because he was from King's Landing. He finds his Dornish clothes comfortable, but his father would have been horrified to see him wearing them. His house proudly recalls Lord Edgerran the Open-Handed, seated with one hundred Dornish heads at his feet, the Three Leaves pierced by Dornish spears in the Prince's Pass as Alester sounded his warhorn with his dying breath, and Ser Olyvar the Green Oak of the Kingsguard, who died defending King Daeron I. The people of Sunspear knew his history too and eyed him with hostility even before Prince Oberyn was killed. Afterwards it was even worse, although the streets have been quieter since Prince Doran confined the Sand Snakes. Still, he knows that if he wears his white cloak in the city, it will mean his death. He hopes that ""she"" will understand and laments the weakness of men, thinking of King Baelor the Blessed, who would fast to the point of fainting in an attempt to tame his lusts.
Arys left Myrcella playing a game from Volantis called Cyvasse with Trystane. The game had come from Volantis via the Planky Town, and the entire Dornish court has gone crazy for it. Myrcella learned the game to spend more time with Trystane, with whom she has become fast friends. He is concerned for her, but he left two guards on the door, and Septa Eglantine and Trystane's sworn shield, Ser Gascoyne of the Greenblood, are with them as well. Just a few days before, Doran had an audience with Arys and promised that he would keep Myrcella safe. With Sunspear so inflamed, however, he did not believe she could be kept safe in the castle. He said that he meant to return to the Water Gardens soon and take Myrcella with him so she will be safe. The Gardens were built by Prince Maron Martell for his Targaryen bride,1 to mark Dorne's entry into the Seven Kingdoms, and Doran considers them his sanctuary. He wants to bring Myrcella there in strict secrecy so that no one will know where she is.
He reaches his destination, where Princess Arianne waits for him, naked. Arys had only come to tell her that he was leaving the city, but he cannot resist her allure. They have sex, after which Arys feels great shame, as he always does after having sex with her because it is a betrayal of his vows. In the ten years since he joined the Kingsguard, he had never broken them before meeting Arianne. He has come to convince her that now that he is leaving with Myrcella for the Water Gardens soon, they must end their relationship. Arianne wants him to stay with her, but Arys feels he must end it for the sake of both their honors. She tries to tempt him further, but he continues to insist that he must keep to his vows from now on. She points out that the Bastard of Godsgrace had her maidenhead when she was fourteen, and when her father found out, he did nothing about it. She tells him that other Kingsguard have broken the vow. He thinks of Boros Blount and Preston Greenfield who both broke their vows as well, but does not mention them. He does mention Ser Terrence Toyne, however, who was found abed with the king's mistress. They were both executed and House Toyne disgraced. Arianne mentions Ser Lucamore Strong, who the songs say had three wives and sixteen children. Arys tells her that Lucamore the Lusty was gelded by the rest of the Kingsguard and sent to the Wall by Jaehaerys I. There was Aemon and Naerys as well, though Arys insists that story is false and that Aegon IV spread it so he could set aside Daeron II in favor of Daemon. Arianne reveals that Prince Lewyn had a lover as well, which shocks Arys since it was not recorded in the White Book.
Arianne changes tactics by arguing that it is not his vows but the monsters he served that dishonored him, Robert and Joffrey. Arys disagrees that Robert was a monster, but he is ashamed of the times he was forced to strike Sansa Stark at Joffrey's order. He says Tommen is king now and nothing like his brother, but Arianne points out that Myrcella is far better suited for the job than Tommen. Arys has to agree, because Myrcella is braver, brighter, more confident, and more polished than her younger brother. Arianne says that Myrcella should rule as the eldest child, but Arys points out that the sons come first. Arianne points out that Viserys I meant for Rhaenyra to follow him on the throne, but the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, Ser Criston Cole the Kingmaker, did not want her on the throne and split the Kingsguard and the kingdom in the conflict named the Dance of the Dragons. No one knows for sure why he did it, though stories claim everything from wanting to dominate the rule of the more tractable Aegon II, to defending ancient Andal custom to gaining vengeance because Rhaenyra was an old lover that spurned him. Arianne says Doran means to keep Myrcella a virtual prisoner at the Water Gardens so that she cannot be crowned and implores Arys not to let it happen. Arys is wavering, but not convinced, so Arianne says she is frightened that her father will lock her up just like the Sand Snakes because she has always disappointed him as an heir. Six times he tried to convince her to wed contemptible old men, which she thinks shows his lack of regard. Also, when she was fourteen, she chanced to see a letter Doran had written to her brother, Quentyn saying that he would one day rule Dorne.2 Arys has never met Quentyn, who was sent to serve as a page for Lord Anders Yronwood at a young age, continued to serve him as a squire, and chose to take a knighthood from his hands father than from his Uncle Oberyn. Arys thinks she must have misunderstood the letter, but Arianne reveals that Quentyn is not with Lord Anders in the Boneway as everyone believes, but has instead slipped across the Narrow Sea disguised as a merchant. The Golden Company has broken its contract with Myr, the first time they have ever broken their word. They are exiles from Westeros who want to come home, which Lord Anders well knows since his family rode with Bittersteel during three rebellions by the Blackfyres. Arianne is sure they are with Quentyn and that Anders has been counseling him to eliminate Arianne.3 Arianne's pleas finally move Arys, and he promises to help her see Myrcella crowned.","Brienne travels towards Maidenpool with Podrick, whom she is trying to teach how to be a proper squire and how to fight. They come across a cart being pulled by a farmer and his wife and fall in with them. The man says they had an ox before the war, but it was taken by Northmen. His daughter was also carried off, but she wandered back later. He says that Lord Randyll has rebuilt much of Maidenpool and has hunted down and killed many of the worst outlaws. She asks them about Sansa, but they have not seen her. They are bringing eggs for the wedding that is about to occur of Lord William's daughter and Randyll's son, Dickon. Brienne thinks of how she was betrothed to Lord Caron's younger son when she was seven and he was ten before a chill claimed his life and those of his mother and father. When they arrive at Maidenpool, the guards try to steal the eggs and rape the farmer's wife. Brienne tries to stop them, but they surround her and prepare to attack. Ser Hyle Hunt appears from the gatehouse and puts an end to it. He follows her into the city, mocking her all the while. He asks what her business is and she tells him that she is looking for a man at the Stinking Goose. He tells her where the inn is, but then insists that she see Lord Randyll first. As they pass through the town, Brienne sees signs of rebirth everywhere. Lord Randyll has his soldiers rebuilding the town, and traders are returning to the harbor. She decides that if the Stinking Goose yields nothing she will take a ship to Gulltown and make for the Eyrie. They find Lord Randyll with Lord William in the harbor dispensing justice before a long gallows where several corpses are already hanging. After deciding several more cases, Lord Randyll turns his attention to Brienne and demands to know what she is doing there. Brienne, greatly intimidated by the man, hands him Tommen's order and admits she seeks Sansa. Lord Randyll says she is not there and probably fled North. Brienne reveals the possibility of the Vale, but Randyll tells her of Lysa's death. Lord Randyll gives her leave to go where she will. Hyle offers to lead her to the Stinking Goose, but Brienne declines. Hyle tries to apologize to her for some past act, and tells her that Big Ben Bushy, Richard Farrow, and Will the Stork died on the Blackwater and Mark Mullendore lost half his arm. She turns her back on Hyle and walks off.
Brienne orders Podrick to stable the horses while she goes to the Stinking Goose. Podrick asks if she knows where it is and wonders why she did not let Ser Hyle take them there when she answers in the negative. She tells him that Hyle and some other men with her played a cruel and hurtful game with her when Renly called his banners. It takes Brienne an hour to find the Stinking Goose, which is unkempt and putrid. She asks the proprietor about Nimble Dick. The woman tells her his name is Dick Crabb and that he comes in most nights. Brienne gives the woman a copper to give her a nod when Dick comes in that night and then takes a seat. As she sits, she thinks on how she has no idea now how to find Sansa. She also thinks back to Renly's calling of the banners. She had expected hostility and mockery when she showed up in her armor, but was surprised at the kindness of a select few. Big Ben sent his squire to clean her mail and gifted her a drinking horn, Ser Edmund Ambrose brought flowers and went riding with her, Ser Hyle brought a beautifully illuminated book and sundry other gifts, Ser Richard played love songs on his lute, Ser Hugh Beesbury brought her a pot of honey, Ser Mark made her laugh with the antics of his monkey, and Will the Stork offered to rub her shoulders. She refused them all, and when Ser Owen Inchfield attempted to kiss her, she knocked him backwards into a cookfire. Brienne was perplexed by the behavior until Lord Randyll summoned her. Dickon had overheard four knights laughing about a wager they had. Apparently Ben, Edmund, and Hyle began a game to see who could claim her maidenhead, which soon spread to much of the camp. Each person had to pay a gold dragon to enter the contest, and the winner got the pot. Randyll put an end to the game and blamed Brienne for being there and acting like a camp follower. He strongly urged her to return to Tarth. Her reverie is interrupted by Dick's arrival. She buys him a glass of wine and pays him for information about the fool. He explains the man was there looking for passage for three, and Brienne thinks this might be Sansa and Arya.1 He says he sent them to the Whispers, the ruined seat of Ser Clarence Crabb, which used to be a smuggler's cove but has not been used for thirty years. He agrees to lead Brienne there for six gold dragons.","The Blackbird, captained by a man nicknamed Old Tattersalt, leaves Eastwatch with Sam, Gilly, Maester Aemon, and Dareon. Gilly seems sad and listless, and Sam's attempts to cheer her up fail. The first ten days of the trip are relatively calm, as Blackbird was never far from land. Gilly stays below deck with the baby, who is sick, while Dareon sings for the oarsmen as they row. Maester Aemon spends most of his time on deck gazing at the shore with blind eyes and thinking of the past. He describes how he first came to the wall on the Golden Dragon when he was thirty-five and had been a maester for sixteen years. Aegon V emptied the dungeons so that he would not have to say his vows alone. One of his companions was Bloodraven, who later became Lord Commander of the Watch. As the voyage continues, Sam thinks that it is not as bad as his last sea voyage, taken to the Arbor when he was ten. He had been seasick then too, and mocked by Lord Paxter's two sons, Horas and Hobber. When he returned home, he learned that he had been supposed to stay and become Lord Paxter's cupbearer while Horas came to Horn Hill. If he had performed well, he would have been betrothed to Paxter's daughter. Several days later, the ship nears Skagos. Dareon joins Sam at the rail to talk. They speak of Gilly and the baby. The baby cries constantly except when he is feeding, at which point Gilly begins crying. Gilly's eyes are red all the time now. Sam thinks she is just afraid of the sea. The next day, they are beset by storms. Sam tries to get Maester Aemon to come below, but he likes the feel of the rain on his face. Sam tries to get him to come below later, but he has fallen asleep. When he awakes, he thinks Sam is Aegon V. Sam carries him below and Gilly helps him try to warm the maester. The storms are a constant companion around Skagos, and as they leave sight of land the storms get worse. The crew begins to mutter that Gilly is bad luck and she is the cause; Sam begins guarding her to make sure nothing happens. He also gets Dareon to sing a lullaby for the baby once, but when Gilly starts crying, he stalks off angrily. Sam asks Aemon if he can give her anything for her fear, and the maester tells him that she cries not of fear, but grief. It is obvious to him that she left her son at the Wall and that she now carries Mance's son with her. Jon obviously used threats and other persuasion to get her to switch the babies so that Mance's son would not burn in Melisandre's fires.","Jaime watches as Lord Tywin Lannister's funeral procession prepares to leave King's Landing through the Gate of the Gods. Lord Tywin has been laid out in a tall wagon draped with crimson banners and attended by six silent sisters. The wagon is surrounded by an honor guard of fifty knights and many of the lords of the west trail behind, including Lord Tytos Brax, Lord Antario Jast, Lord Quenten Banefort, Lord Philip Plumm, Lord Garrison Prester, and Lord Robin Moreland. Behind them come a hundred crossbowmen and three hundred men-at-arms. Jaime rides up to Ser Kevan at the head and tries to get him to make his peace with Cersei. He blames her for any trouble and refuses to do any such thing. Jaime asks if he plans to remain at Darry for awhile, and Kevan responds that he means to hunt down Sandor for the butchery at Saltpans.1 Jaime tries to convince him to stay and become Hand, and Kevan replies that Cersei knows his terms and Jaime can remind her of them next time they are in bed together. Jaime realizes that Kevan does in fact know about their incest. Jaime mocks Lancel before riding back to the Red Keep. The streets are largely empty; as the Tyrell host has departed and the men of the west have returned to their homes to plant a final harvest, save for two thousand men camped outside the walls waiting for Lord Paxter's fleet so they can sail for Dragonstone. As Jaime enters the yard of the castle, he watches a group of knights, Tallad, Lyle Crakehall, Kennos, Dermot, Lambert, Jon Bettley, Humfrey Swyft, Alyn Stackspear, Ronnet Connington, and Loras, ride against a quintain and laments that his jousting days are over. When he arrives in Cersei's solar, she is attended by Tommen, Taena, and Grand Maester Pycelle, who has just received a bird from Castle Stokeworth. Lollys has delivered a son, and Bronn has named the boy Tyrion. Cersei is drunk, and Jaime notes that she has been drinking heavily of late. She is also annoyed at the name, and Jaime thinks she means to have Bronn killed. Jaime is worried for Cersei. He thinks back to the burning of the Tower of the Hand and the ecstasy on her face as the flames consumed the tower. He remembers how Aerys II would always be aroused by a burning and go to Rhaella. After he burned Lord Qarlton, Jaime and Jon Darry escorted him to Rhaella's room, the king and queen slept apart in the last years of his reign, and stood outside as he savaged her in his passion. Jaime wanted to protect her, but Jon told him that it was not their place. The morning Rhaella left for Dragonstone, Jaime heard the maid's whisper that she looked as if some beast had savaged her, clawing her thighs and chewing her breasts. Aerys had allowed no blades in his presence by the end save the swords of the Kingsguard, and his nails had grown to nine inches long. Jaime asks for a word alone, and the others depart. He chastises her for keeping Taena near her, as she is obviously a spy for Margaery. Cersei explains that she feeds Margaery some information through Taena and that Taena tells her everything about Margaery. Jaime tries to convince her to make use of Kevan against Stannis, but Cersei says that Roose will deal with him. Jaime points out that he is trapped below the Neck by the ironmen, but Cersei says that Ramsay will remove them after which Roose will march with his own men plus two thousand Freys led by Hosteen and Aenys. Jaime says she should make Kevan Hand then, but she will not. She thinks she may make Orton Merryweather Hand to please Taena, and Jaime thinks that is a terrible idea. He says a strong Hand is needed, but Cersei thinks she is strong enough to rule herself. He asks her if it is true that she is naming Aurane Waters master of ships, and she confirms this. Jaime says Lord Paxter would be a better choice since he commands the largest fleet in Westeros, but Cersei will have no Tyrell bannermen on her small council. Jaime tries to talk her out of using Qyburn as well, but she will not listen. He tries to tell her that she is becoming paranoid and should not make an enemy of Kevan, and she snaps and throws him out. Loras finds him hunched over the White Book hours later. Jaime asks him if he has heard of several members of the Kingsguard, and Loras has only heard of a handful. Jaime says that most are forgotten, with only the heroic and the despicable remembered, as well as some who possessed both qualities like the man whose page he is staring at, Ser Criston Cole the Kingmaker.","Cersei watches as three ruffians approach with a leather sack. Qyburn tells her the small council is waiting, but she says they may await her pleasure. One of the men pulls a rotting head out of the sack, causing Dorcas and Jocelyn to recoil in horror. It is the head of a dwarf, but not of Tyrion. The men start to bicker, and one mentions the dwarf said he was a sparrow.1 Cersei thinks about executing them, but worries this will cause others to hesitate to come forward and lets them leave. She has Ser Meryn take the head and Ser Osmund escort the men out. This is the third head that has been delivered. Cersei thinks of Maggy again and how Melara said if they forgot the prophecy it would not come true. Qyburn assures her that he has informers everywhere and that Tyrion will be found. Qyburn has also cleaned Ser Gregor's skull for presentation to Prince Doran.2 The bells of the Great Sept are ringing in the background, tolling for the death of the High Septon. Cersei and Qyburn, who has been made master of whisperers, make their way to the council chamber, where Ser Boros stands guard. Inside, the council waits.
When Cersei introduces Qyburn as Varys's replacement, Grand Maester Pycelle is appalled. Cersei has replaced most of the council with people loyal to her and given them new titles. Besides Grand Maester Pycelle there is Orton Merryweather, her justiciar, Gyles Rosby, her lord treasurer, Aurane Waters, her high admiral, and Ser Harys Swyft, her new Hand of the King. Harys is there more as hostage than councilor, since his daughter is married to Kevan. Lord Orton asks if Tommen or Jaime will be joining them, but Tommen never attends meetings and Jaime is being fitted with a new hand. Prince Doran has written that Dorne is still seething and that he cannot control the people unless his justice is served. Cersei informs the council that Gregor has died and Ser Balon will be going to Sunspear to deliver the head.2 Ser Harys brings up the sparrows. There are two thousand or more in the city now preaching about doom and devil worship. Cersei tells them that the old High Septon let too much pass and was old and done. Qyburn smiles at Pycelle and says his passing should surprise no one.3 The leading candidates to succeed him are Torbert, Raynard, Ollidor, and Luceon. Talk of septons bores Cersei, and she begins pondering having sex with Aurane. She finally ends the discussion by saying she does not care who is the next High Septon as long as he declares anathema on Tyrion and that the sparrows do not concern her either.
Cersei has Pycelle produce another letter, this one from the Vale. It is a declaration signed by Lords Yohn, Gilwood, Horton, and Benedar, Lady Anya, and Ser Symond. They have gathered beneath the Eyrie and declared their intent to remove Lord Petyr. Petyr has not asked for any assistance, and indeed seemed unconcerned in his last letter. Orton suggests that it really does not matter who is regent in the Vale, and Cersei orders a letter sent to the Lords Declarant stating that as long as Petyr is not harmed, she does not care what they do. Aurane shifts the discussion to the royal fleet. Less than a dozen ships survived the Blackwater, and Aurane thinks they must rebuild their strength at sea. Orton suggests an alliance with Greyjoy, but they want the North, which is already promised to Roose. Aurane suggests building ten new dromonds. Pycelle asks where the gold is to come from, and Lord Gyles, coughing up bloody phlegm between words, says there is not enough money. Though revenues are greater than ever, they cannot keep up with Robert's debts. Cersei decides to defer payments to the Faith and the Iron Bank of Braavos until the conclusion of the war to pay for the fleet. Pycelle tries to make the queen reconsider, as the Iron Bank is ruthless about collecting its debts, but she will not listen. Lord Walder has sent a letter putting forth several more claims. The sparrows have been aggressively preaching against him and the Red Wedding in the streets. Cersei figures he will die soon and that his heir could then blame a few of his relations for the act and execute them to appease the North. Aurane informs the council that the Golden Company has broken its contract with Myr and may be joining Stannis. Cersei assures them that Qyburn has discovered they are headed for Volantis.4 Lord Janos has reported that Stannis is making common cause with the wildlings, but Cersei is not concerned. Umber and Ryswell, among others, have already joined Ramsay Bolton to clear Moat Cailin, and Wyman Manderly is on the verge of joining as well, having already agreed to marry his granddaughters to Freys and open his port to Lannister ships. Lord Wyman has also been sending on Stannis's missives demanding fealty to King's Landing and has put Davos, Stannis's envoy, in a cell. Cersei will order Wyman to execute Davos. She is certain he will obey, as the Starks are dead save for Sansa, and Roose is having Ramsay marry a fake Arya who is actually ""some steward's whelp.""5 This talk leads naturally to Jon's election as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. Pycelle wants to withhold men from the Watch until he is removed, but Qyburn proposes that they send a hundred men to join the Watch instead and have them remove Jon from command. Cersei likes this idea. Aurane brings up one last point, strange talk of dragons from the docks, but Cersei does not want to hear about it and ends the session.
Ser Boros escorts Cersei back to her chambers, where Taena waits with Jocelyn and Dorcas. They are laughing over Horas and Hobber, who have apparently both fallen in love with Margaery and want to join the Kingsguard to be close to her. Cersei has Dorcas fetch Ser Osney. When Osney arrives, she sends her ladies out. Osney is overly familiar with her, and has actually already had sex with her on one occasion. Cersei orders him to seduce Margaery. She plans to have Margaery executed for adultery and Osney sent to the Wall to kill Jon. Afterwards, he would be pardoned, raised to a lordship, and become Cersei's consort. When he leaves, Cersei summons Taena and tells her to let Margaery know that Ser Osney fancies the young queen. That night, she dreams of being presented with Tyrion's head, having it bronzed and placing it in her chamberpot.","Iron Victory enters Nagga's Cradle off of Old Wyk. Victarion joins Nute the Barber at the prow as the remains of the Grey King's hall come into view. He remembers how Balon stood beneath those ruins at the beginning of Greyjoy's Rebellion to be crowned by Tarle and hailed as king. Nute assures him he will be likewise hailed, but Victarion is not so sure. He did not want to claim the crown, despite many of his captains, including Red Ralf Stonehouse, Ralf Kenning, and Ralf the Limper, trying to convince him that he could not allow Euron to sit the Seastone Chair, but when Aeron called the kingsmoot, he left Ralf Kenning in charge at Moat Cailin and set sail for Old Wyk with nine-tenths of the Iron Fleet. Fickle winds and rough seas delayed his arrival, but only one ship was lost. Behind Iron Victory, the rest of the Iron Fleet sails in a ragged line, including Grief, Iron Vengeance, Hardhand, Iron Wind, Grey Ghost, Lord Quellon, Lord Vickon, and Lord Dagon. The bay is full of longships, many of which Victarion recognizes, including Lord Rodrik's Sea Song, Lord Dunstan's Thunderer, Lord Baelor's Nightflyer, Silverfin, which had been Lord Sawane's ship, and Silence. Victarion orders Grief and Iron Vengeance to take up position between Silence and the sea and for the rest of the fleet to seal off the bay before going ashore. Aeron greets him at the water's edge and blesses him with seawater. Men of many houses swarm him as he comes ashore, and that night he feasts fifty famous captains. Those in attendance include Fralegg the Strong, Alvyn Sharp, and Hotho Harlaw. Hotho offers him a bride, but he says he has no luck with wives. He has had three in total, the first died in childbirth with a stillborn daughter, the second died of a pox, and he beat the third to death. Lord Baelor also speaks to him of ending the war. His father was killed during Greyjoy's Rebellion and he was a hostage in Oldtown for eight years, becoming a worshiper of the Seven. He considers all of Victarion's brothers to be mad and wants Victarion to end the war, which he will not commit to doing. As the evening continues, Will Humble loses a wager and has to eat his boot, Lenwood Tawney fiddles while Romny Weaver sings reaving songs, and Qarl and Eldred Codd dance the finger dance until Eldred loses a finger.
Late in the evening, Asha makes an appearance. She tells Victarion that more than Greyjoys will be fighting over the throne. Dunstan Drumm plans to make a claim, and Tarle has been heard to say that Maron Volmark is the true heir. Victarion says a Greyjoy must be king, and Asha agrees, but says that Euron comes before Victarion and Asha comes before them both. Just then, a new group of people come in, including Jon Myre, Torwold, Lucas Codd, Germund Botley, Orkwood, Stonehand, Quellon Humble, the Red Oarsman, Ralf the Shepherd, Ralf of Lordsport, Qarl the Thrall, and Euron Crow's Eye. Euron spars with Aeron, causing him to leave in disgust. Asha accuses him of killing Balon, which he denies, and gets into a sparring match with his supporters until Victarion brings an end to it. Victarion tells Euron to go, and he does. Many others leave as well, and much of the merriment in the tent dies. Asha asks Victarion to walk with her outside. When they are alone, she asks why Euron left three years ago; she had been in the Stepstones stealing from Lyseni pirates at the time. Victarion does not want to talk about it. He tells Asha she will never be queen, and Asha reluctantly agrees. She has been courting captains for four days and nights and only has her own men, the Harlaws, Tristifer, and a few others to show for it. She proposes that Victarion become king with her as his Hand, a position that has never existed among the ironmen. She wants to end the war. Lady Sybelle has assured her that if they hand back Deepwood Motte, Torrhen's Square, and Moat Cailin, the Northmen will cede Sea Dragon Point and the Stony Shore. This would give the ironmen the land they need, and the two sides can make common cause against the Iron Throne if attacked. Victarion says that Sea Dragon Point and the Stony Shore are already in their possession and that with Robb dead, there are none to oppose them in conquering the whole North. Asha disagrees, but Victarion will hear no more and rejects her offer. Asha says he needs her for the Harlaws, but he counters that Hotho is already with him and that he will have the Harlaws and the throne. Asha warns him that all the captains are talking about Euron and not of either of them. She asks if Euron killed his wife, and Victarion explains that Euron had put a baby in her belly and forced Victarion to kill her. Balon exiled him, never to return as long as Balon lived. Asha leaves, saying she will put in a claim for the Seastone Chair.","Aeron walks from the sea to Nagga's bones to preside over the kingsmoot just before dawn. Some time later, Rus and his other drowned man arrive, and he tells them to summon the captains and kings for the choosing. Aeron recognizes several as they arrive, Sigfry Stonetree, Andrik the Unsmiling, Ser Harras Harlaw, Lord Baelor Blacktyde, the Stonehouse, and Victarion. Aeron asks who will come forward to claim the throne, and Lord Gylbert Farwynd makes a claim. He comes forward with his champions, his sons Gyles, Ygon, and Yohn. Gylbert, apparently mad, speaks of a paradise beyond the Sunset Sea where he would lead them and offers gifts of little value. Not even all his own family takes up the cry for him. The next to rise is Erik Ironmaker, championed by his grandsons, Urek, Thormor, and Dagon. A few men take up the chant for him, until Asha comes forward and tells him to stand up to claim his crown. He is unable to rise, and is carried off in shame. The next to come forward is Dunstan Drumm, carrying his Valyrian steel blade, Red Rain, and championed by his sons, Denys and Donnel, and Andrik. He begins be reminding the crowd that while Vickon Greyjoy was chosen to rule the ironmen after the death of Harren that he was chosen to rule as lord, not king. He then regales the crowd with tails of his illustrious ancestors such as Dale the Dread, Roryn the Reaver, Gormund Drumm the Oldfather and his one hundred sons, and Hilmar Drumm the Cunning, who took Red Rain from a knight, supposedly using only his wits and a wooden cudgel. The crowd is interested, until he reveals his treasures, which are poor and mostly bronze.
At this crucial stage, Aeron catches Victarion's attention, and he comes forward to make his claim. He rises with his champions, Ralf the Limper, Red Ralf Stonehouse, and Nute the Barber, speaks of his prowess, and gives the crowd of wealth of gold and gems and plunder. Nearly all assembled take up the cry in his name, until Asha whistles to cut through the noise. She comes forward and begins to speak, mocking her uncle and sparring with several others, including the Red Oarsman, and Lucas Codd. After a time her champions come forward, Qarl the Maid, Tristifer Botley, and Ser Harras Harlaw. She tells the assembled that they cannot win the war they are currently waging and says they have gained nothing from the victories they have already won. She opens three chests to show the riches of the north, the pebbles of the Stony Shore, the pine cones of Deepwood, and the turnips of Winterfell. She turns to Harmund Sharp and tells him that his son, Harrag, died at Winterfell for these turnips and asks if he would lose more sons. He asks what she will give them, and she answers peace, enough land for every son to build a hall, and friendship with the northmen. Lord Rodrik takes up the cry for her, and others follow, including Lord Meldred Merlyn. Victarion's supporters began to shout back. Just as a riot is about to begin, a horn blast pierces the air. All turn to look at one of Euron's crew1 sounding a shiny black horn banded with red gold and dark steel and incised with ancient Valyrian glyphs. The glyphs begin to glow as the sound goes on and on, until the man finally runs out of breath and the noise subsides. Orkwood has to catch the man and hold him up, and Aeron sees that he has blood blisters on his lips and is bleeding from his chest. Euron climbs the steps to the Grey King's hall and addresses the captains and kings. He tells them that he will bring them victory and all of Westeros. He found the horn in the smoking ruins of Valyria and says that it can bind dragons to his will. Asha points out there are no more dragons, but Euron says he knows where to find three. Lucas and the Red Oarsman begin the cry as Euron unloads his treasures for the assembled. Soon Hotho Harlaw joins in, then Gorold Goodbrother, then Erik Ironmaker until everyone is shouting Euron's name.","Dick leads Brienne and Podrick along the coast through villages that get smaller and smaller as they progress. Each night, they stay at an inn, but Brienne does not trust Dick at all and makes him sleep with other travelers in the common bed. She tells Podrick that when they enter the wilderness and have to make their own camp, he will stay awake to watch her sleep and make sure Dick does not pull anything. One day, he does try to steal Brienne's gold, but her saddlebags are merely a decoy filled mostly with flour, and she keeps her gold well hidden on her person. As they travel, Dick sings and tells stories of Crackclaw Point. He describes how Aegon sent Visenya to subdue the people of Crackclaw Point after Harrenhal was burned. Knowing of that event, they swore fealty readily, and in return she promised them that they would not be subject to anyone save the throne itself. They remain Targaryen loyalists to this day. Crabbs, Brunes, and Boggses fought with Rhaegar at the Trident, while a Hardy, a Cave, a Pyne, and three Crabbs served in the Kingsguard. The three Crabbs were Ser Clement, Ser Rupert, and Ser Clarence the Short, so named because even though he was six feet tall, he was still shorter than the semi-legendary Ser Clarence so revered in the region.
One night, there are no more inns, and they bed down in a hayloft in a fishing village. She makes Dick sleep down below and pulls the ladder up. He complains about her mistrust, and she thinks about how she used to be very trusting, until Septa Roelle explained to her that all the people who complemented her only did it to win Lord Selwyn's favor. She thinks about the melee at Bitterbridge.1 Her anger at her suitors gave her incredible strength, and she took them down one by one, Richard Farrow, Edmund Ambrose, Mark Mullendore, Raymond Nayland, Will the Stork, Harry Sawyer, and Robin Potter. Next she faced Ronnet Connington, and was pleased to take him down as well for the scorn he had showed her years ago. That left Loras, to whom she bore no enmity, but she disliked roses, and the golden roses on his shield inflamed her and brought victory. She goes to sleep dreaming of the melee, but it is Jaime who gives her the cloak of the Rainbow Guard when she is victorious. The next day, it rains all day as they carry on. The day after that, they arrive outside Dyre Den, where Lord Eustace Brune has his seat. The road ends there, and Dick leads them up into the hills. As they climb, Podrick calls their attention to a rider following a few miles behind them. Dick denies knowledge of him and says that he is probably a singer or a soldier returning home. Even if he is following them, they can lose him in the hills. After several days travel through forests and bogs, they arrive at the Whispers. They circle around to a postern gate, and notice signs of recent activity. Brienne tells Dick to come with her while Podrick watches the horses. Brienne gives Dick her sword and draws Oathkeeper. The remains of a fire sit in the middle of the ruin. Dick calls out, and a man appears. Brienne realizes it is Pyg. Two more men come out as well. Shagwell appears right above Dick. He drops down, shatters Dick's knee with his morning star, and then kills the man with a blow to the face. The other man is Timeon. Shagwell begins talking. He tells Brienne that the Brave Companions have scattered. Urswyck headed for Oldtown, while Rorge went to Saltpans. The three of them made for Maidenpool, but could not get near a ship. Vargo stayed at Harrenhal, where Gregor killed him piece by piece, taking his hands, then his feet, etc. and preventing him from bleeding to death. He was saving the cock for last, but he was summoned to King's Landing and killed Vargo before he left. Brienne says she is not there for him and is looking for Sansa Stark. Timeon says Sandor has her and was making for Riverrun. He knows because they captured and interrogated three members of the Brotherhood Without Banners, who are also searching for her. Later, Rorge interrogated the innkeeper where Sandor fought three of Gregor's men2 and had the same story from him before killing him. Brienne realizes that they are talking to distract her while Pyg and Timeon flank her. Brienne lunges towards Pyg and kills him quickly. The other two go to either side of her so that if she attacks one, the other will be at her back. A rock flies out of nowhere to hit Shagwell in the head, so Brienne engages and kills Timeon. Podrick hits Shagwell with a second rock as he tries to recover his weapon, and he yields. Brienne orders him to dig a grave for Dick. As Brienne lowers Dick's body into the grave, Shagwell comes at her with a rock. Brienne was expecting it, and stabs him with her dagger repeatedly, letting all her pent up anger out. When this is done she throws two gold coins into the grave. Podrick asks about the gold, and she explains that it was the price she agreed to pay Dick for leading them there. Ser Hyle materializes at that point. Lord Randyll had ordered him to follow her on the off chance she actually found Sansa. Hyle asks what she will do next, and she says she will track the Hound. Brienne asks for Hyle's help covering the grave, and they do it together.","Arianne arrives at the abandoned well at Shandystone with Drey and Sylva. Garin and Darkstar are already there when they arrive. Not many people remember Shandystone, but Oberyn had taken her, Tyene, and Sarella there when they were children. Oberyn taught Tyene how to safely milk a viper while Sarella acquainted herself with the history of the ruins and Arianne dreamed of her uncle having his way with her, a memory that disturbs her now. Garin had been with them as well, as he is Arianne's milkbrother and they have been inseparable since before they could walk. At the end of the day, Oberyn had told the story of his namesake, Garin the Great, a prince of the Rhoynar who defied Valyria, but ended up dead along with his army of half a million men.
That night, Garin tells them some of the news of the world that he learned in Planky Town. There are many events of note in the east, including a slave riot in Astapor,1 dragons in Qarth,2 and grey plague in Yi Ti. A new corsair king has arisen in the Basilisk Isles and raided Tall Trees Town, and followers of the Lord of Light attempted to burn down the Black Goat in Qohor. Finally, the Golden Company broke its contract with Myr. Sylva suggests they were bought off, but Arianne is convinced that her brother Quentyn has secured their services to set her aside and become the next ruler of Dorne. She vows to herself not to go down without a fight and takes solace in the fact that she is popular with the people of Dorne while Quentyn is practically a stranger to them.
Ser Gerold goes off to relieve himself, and Garin voices his distrust of the man. Arianne reminds them that they need his prowess with the sword and his castle. As her companions banter, Arianne's thoughts return to Quentyn. He was fostered at a very young age as payment of a blood debt to Lord Ormond Yronwood,3 and Mellario never forgave Prince Doran for doing so. Prince Doran continues to pretend that Quentyn is at Yronwood, but Garin's mother spotted him at Planky Town with Cletus Yronwood and a maester skilled in tongues.4 They were travelling across the Narrow Sea under false names and bearing letters sealed with the sun and spear of House Martell. She is positive he is making a move to remove her as heir. Ser Gerold returns and tells Arianne that crowning Myrcella will not get her the vengeance she wants against the Lannisters. He suggests killing her instead, but Arianne refuses.
Ser Arys arrives with Myrcella. Drey, Sylva, and Garin acknowledge Myrcella as their queen, confusing her. Arianne says that as the eldest child, she should sit the Iron Throne. After introducing her companions to Myrcella, Ser Arys takes Arianne aside and tells her Lord Tywin is dead, Tyrion has fled, and Cersei rules as regent. Arianne sees this as a positive development, as it might make the kingdom more amenable to a female ruler. Arianne asks if Arys had any problems getting there. He did not; his ruse worked perfectly. He used Myrcella's cousin and companion, Rosamund, as a decoy and claimed she had redspot fever,5 to keep people away. She is a convincing decoy. Ser Arys's decoy is not as good because of those taking part in the ruse Dake, closest in height, was too fat, and he was forced to use a man named Rolder, who is three inches too short. Arianne is not concerned, as they only need a few days. Arys wants to know the rest of the plan, but Arianne rebuffs him and says it is time to move.
As the party rides through the night, Arianne thinks of her plans. Once she has crowned Myrcella and freed the Sand Snakes, she believes that the people of Dorne will rally to her for vengeance against the Lannisters, allowing her to depose her father and forestall her brother. She believes only the Yronwoods would declare for Quentyn, and if they do she plans to have Ser Gerold destroy the house. Myrcella begins to complain about the long ride, but Arianne assures her that the journey will be easier once they reach the Greenblood and can travel by boat with Garin's people, the orphans of the river. When Nymeria wed Mors Martell after fleeing Essos, she burned her ships to symbolize a new beginning for her people. Most were eager to start a new life, but a small number chose not to embrace the Faith and keep to the old ways. They constructed new boats from the burnt out hulks of the old and have lived a nomadic life on the river ever since. They continue to worship the Rhoyne River as a god along with several lesser gods such as the Old Man of the River, a turtle god that fought the Crab King to win dominion over all creatures who dwell beneath the water.
Myrcella is clearly growing tired, and Arianne almost calls a halt to rest, but Ser Gerold reminds her they must hurry, for the heat will be unbearable during the day and they have no tents for protection. After riding through the night and part of the next day, they finally reach the Greenblood. From there they will travel by boat to Vaith and then across the desert to Sandstone and Hellholt. Prince Oberyn fostered at Sandstone in his youth, and his paramour Ellaria Sand is the bastard daughter of Lord Harmen Uller of Hellholt, so she has no doubt both castles will aid them. She decides that Hellholt will be the place where she crowns Myrcella and calls her banners.
The party comes to their boat after half a league of travel downstream, but when they hail it, Areo Hotah steps out with a dozen men armed with crossbows and throwing spears. Areo tells Arianne to yield, or he will be forced to kill everyone save her and Myrcella. Arianne agrees to yield, but Ser Arys refuses to hand over Myrcella while he still draws breath. Knowing he is hopelessly outnumbered, he charges anyway. He manages to gain the deck despite his horse being peppered with quarrels and even takes out three men before he is peppered with crossbow bolts. Areo finishes the job by taking off his arm and his head. As Arianne falls from her saddle sobbing and retching, Areo roars for his men to pursue someone as Myrcella wails on the ground shaking with blood between her fingers.6 Arianne asks Areo how he knew they were going to be there, and he replies that someone told.","Every night before bed, Arya recites the list of names of people she wants to kill. The kindly man overhears her and asks who they are. When Arya explains, he tells her that it is not her choice who dies, but rather the choice of the Many-Faced God. Arya lives below the temple with the waif, three acolytes, two serving men, and a cook named Umma. The only person she interacts with who knows the Common Tongue is the kindly man. Every day, he asks who she is. She answers that she is no one, though in her heart she is still Arya Stark. Every day before dawn, they say a prayer to the Many-Faced God. Since she does not know the language, she recites her list of names silently. During the day, she works at various jobs. When not at work, she is free to explore the vaults of the temple as long as she does not descend to the third floor, where the holy sanctum lies. One day, the kindly man comes upon her unexpectedly. She says he is lost, but he knows she lies. He asks who she is, and when she applies no one, he knows that is a lie too. The kindly man allows Arya to ask questions. Once, she asks why the people who come to the temple seeking death are not afraid. He responds that death is a relief, not a burden, and if they are worried, the candles calm them. He asks Arya what she smells from the candles. She thinks they smell of Winterfell, but she lies that she smells nothing. As always, the kindly man knows she lies. He tells her she can leave at any time to go home, but that she would not be allowed back again. She says she does not want to leave. He says that she must serve then, as all men must serve, or as they say it, ''Valar dohaeris''. Her jobs are many, including helping in the kitchen, sweeping the temple floor, serving meals, sorting through the belongings of the dead, and attending the kindly man as he makes a circuit of the temple to discover who has recently died. The dead are always stripped and taken to the third level, though Arya does not know what happens after that.
Arya sleeps in a small cell all her own, where she keeps the gifts she received from the crew of the Titan's Daughter and Needle. She practices swordplay as often as she can. One day, the waif sees her at practice, and the next day the kindly man pays a visit. He tells her that she must give up all her possessions if she means to stay. They belong to Arya Stark, and Arya Stark is too proud for the temple. Arya says that she serves, but the kindly man says that deep down, she is still a lord's daughter. He tells her that there are other paths for her if she prefers. She can become a courtesan employed by the Black Pearl or the Daughter of the Dusk, she can be married to any type of person she desires, or she can sail on Luco Prestayn's Lady Bright for Westeros the very next day. She says she wants to stay. The kindly man warns that few women serve the Many-Faced God, as women bring life and the god brings death. He further says that the god will consume her and take every part of her and that he believes she cannot handle that. Arya claims she can give up anything she wants, and the man tells her to start with her possessions. That night, she sneaks out of the temple and throws everything into the river: her silver fork, floppy hat, fingerless gloves, dagger, swordbelt, pouch of coins, clothes, and smallclothes. Everything except Needle. For her, it is a last reminder of home, and she is sure the Old Gods meant for her to have it; she cannot bear to part with it. One of the temple steps has a loose stone, and she hides Needle in there. The next day, the kindly man tells Arya of the beginning of the Faceless Men. At the end, he asks once again who Arya is. She answers ""no one,"" but as always, he knows she is lying. She asks how he always sees through her lies, and he answers that it is possible to tell by examining a person's face. Arya wants to learn, and the man says the waif will teach her, starting with language. They will teach each other; Arya will learn Braavosi while the waif learns the Common Tongue. From that day forth, she is a novice of the Many-Faced God and wears a robe half black, half white. The waif learns the Common Tongue quickly, but Arya has difficulty with Braavosi. One day, the waif asks Arya who she is, and knows Arya lies in her response. From that day, they begin a lying game, where Arya has to guess when the waif is lying and when she is not. One night, they ask each other their age, and the waif claims she is thirty-six. Arya asks the kindly man if this is true, and he confirms it. She takes care of the poisons used by the temple, and handling them has given her a shrunken appearance.
There are several servants of the many-Faced God who visit the temple often. Arya does not know their names, so gives them labels as well such as the fat fellow, the stern face, the handsome man, the squinter, the lordling, and the starved man. One time, she is ordered to serve the fat fellow and the squinter as they talk. Afterwards, Arya asks if they were wearing their real faces. The kindly man asks what she thinks, and she says no. She asks after Jaqen again, but the kindly man once again denies knowing him. She asks about changing one's face, and the kindly man responds that it is a spell that takes years of practice and sacrifice. He advises her to start by practicing making faces and controlling her muscles. She is soon given the new task of helping the other acolytes prepare the corpses of those who died at the temple. Her days are then spent washing the dead, making faces in the mirrors, learning the Braavosi tongue, and trying to become no one. One day, the kindly man tells her that her Braavosi, while still bad, is good enough for the moment and that it is time for her to leave for awhile, as she will only master the tongue by speaking it all day long. She is to serve a man named Brusco, who sells shellfish by pushing his cart through the streets and peddling his wares. As a cover identity, she is to be Cat, an orphan from King's Landing whose father had been an oarsman on the ship Nymeria. That night, she leaves the temple saying her litany of names happily as she runs for the docks.","Sansa awakes with the rising sun. Gretchel fetches her robe and gets a fire going while Sansa goes out to her balcony to look over the Vale. As she looks down over the approach to the Giant's Lance, she can see the host of the Lords Declarant camped outside the Gates of the Moon. They are six thousand strong, one thousand from each of the lords. They are Lord Benedar Belmore, Ser Symond Templeton, Lord Horton Redfort, Lady Anya Waynwood, Lord Gilwood Hunter, and their leader, Lord Yohn Royce. After Lysa died, they met at Runestone and made a pact to defend Lord Robert, the Vale, and each other and made it their goal to rescue Robert from the ""misrule"" of ""false friends and evil counselors."" Sansa goes back inside to dress. Petyr has given her Lysa's entire wardrobe, and while most are too big, some of the oldest fit her. Sansa joins Lord Robert, who is at breakfast. He is annoyed because he wanted eggs but received only porridge; the Lords Declarant have refused to let any food up. Robert is grumpy because he did not sleep last night; he claims he heard Marillion singing again, but Sansa assures him the singer is dead. Lord Petyr arrives with Maester Colemon and informs Robert that his lords are coming to see him. Lord Nestor is showing up the six lords, and Ser Lyn Corbray is coming with them as well. Sansa is not pleased that Ser Lyn is coming, as he has a fearsome reputation for the many men he has killed in battles and duels. He won his knighthood during Robert's Rebellion, where he first fought against Lord Jon before Gulltown and later fought under Robert's banners on the Trident, where he slew Prince Lewyn Martell. Robert does not want Ser Lyn there either, but Petyr reminds him that he is the ruler until Robert's sixteenth birthday and orders Mela to fetch Robert another spoon for his porridge. Robert throws his porridge bowl at Petyr instead, which hits Maester Colemon, and has a shaking spell. Maester Colemon tells Petyr that the spells have gotten more frequent and more violent since Lysa died. He says that he bleeds the boy as often as he can and uses dreamwine to make the boy sleep, but it is not enough. He says that Lysa would nurse him when the shaking became especially bad, as breastmilk is supposed to have healthful properties, but Petyr is disgusted at the thought of continuing to breastfeed the boy and suggests using a pinch of sweet sleep in Robert's milk to calm him. Colemon is worried about that course, but Petyr insists, and the maester hurries out to prepare Robert for his meeting with the Lords Declarant. Petyr asks for a kiss from Sansa, who gives him a dutiful peck on the cheek. Afterwards, he tells her she will attend the lords as they talk and that she had best change into a different dress, as the one she sports now features Tully colors. Sansa is afraid that Lord Yohn will recognize her, as she saw him at Winterfell when he was bringing his son, Waymar, north to the wall and again at the Hand's tournament in King's Landing, but Petyr says she looks different now and that Yohn will see only what he expects to see. Sansa thinks Petyr should just give the Lords Declarant Robert since they already control the Vale. Petyr counters that he does have some friends, Lord Gerold Grafton of Gulltown, Lord Jon Lynderly, and Lord Lyonel Corbray among them, but admits he does not have power to counter the Lords Declarant. He says they have no place to go, and dismisses Harrenhal when Sansa brings it up. The only use Harrenhal had for him was that it was a great enough seat that he could marry Lysa. Petyr tells Sansa to be about her duties.
Sansa prepares the refreshments and the room and changes into a far more modest dress and then receives the Lords Declarant. She escorts them to the solar, where Ser Lothor awaits to admit them. After they are seated, Petyr addresses them. He praises their declaration and asks to be allowed to sign as well, as he would like to root out the false friends and evil counselors and defend Robert as well. The lords are not amused and tell Petyr they want him gone. They plan to take Robert to Runestone, where he can be raised by Yohn, instructed and cared for by members of his household such as Maester Helliweg, Strong Sam Stone, and Septon Lucos, and be surrounded by boys his own age. Petyr says that he means to find Robert more suitable companions, and that Lord Gerold and Lord Jon are each sending a son about Robert's age. He also asks Lady Anya if she will send Harrold Hardyng, which amuses her greatly. The lords insist he leave once again and that he has no right to be there. He says that Lysa named him Lord Protector of the Vale and ward of her son, and Lord Nestor speaks up that Lysa had every right to decide who would care for her own son. The lords are not appeased and repeat their demands for Robert, and the negotiations have reached an impasse. At this point, Lyn draws Lady Forlorn and says they should settle it with steel, a duel between him and Petyr. The other Lords Declarant are outraged and put a stop to the challenge, causing Lyn to walk out. Petyr is furious and threatens the lords for the act and says that if they want war, he will fight. He proposes that he be given a year to set the Vale aright. Lord Horton and Lady Anya agree first, and soon all acquiesce save Yohn, who hates the idea but has no other choice and departs in anger. That evening, there is a feast hosted by Robert and attended by all save Lyn and Yohn, who have already left. That night, Sansa cannot sleep and goes to Petyr's room to ask what happens in a year. Petyr is confident that he will be in control, as Horton and Anya are old, Gilwood will probably be murdered by his brother, Harlan, who was the one that killed Lord Eon, Benedar can be bought, Symond can be befriended, and Yohn is not a threat if he stands alone. Sansa asks about Ser Lyn, and Petyr replies that he will remain Petyr's implacable enemy. Sansa realizes that Lyn has been working for Petyr all along.","Tommen attends Cersei as Dorcas finishes dressing her for court. He tells her that he wants to sit the Iron Throne, and when Cersei forbids it, says the throne is his by right. Cersei asks who told him that, and he lies that no one did. Cersei says that if he lies, she will have to have Pate, Tommen's whipping boy as he had also been Joffrey, beaten. Tommen admits Margaery put him up to it. She also wants him to attend small council meetings so he can learn how to rule. Cersei tells him that he is still too young, as she means to stay in power until Tommen comes of age. She spends the morning with Lord Gyles going over the ledgers and then with Aurane, who reports the first three dromonds are almost complete. Cersei authorizes more money to finish them. She takes lunch during a meeting with a group of merchants complaining about the sparrows wandering the streets and sleeping in the squares while Moon Boy entertains. Grand Maester Pycelle enters next. He has been speaking up more in council of late, and most recently objected to the men Aurane chose to captain the new dromonds, arguing that they were too young and that captains who survived the Blackwater should have been given the command. He reports that Lord Wyman has beheaded Davos. His head and hands have been mounted on the walls of White Harbor and the Freys have confirmed the deed. Cersei says to send a bird to Lord Wyman saying that his son, Wylis, will be returned to him. Cersei is pleased with the progress of the war. Roose and Ramsay are closing in on Moat Cailin from north and south, while Lord Mace has invested Storm's End. Cersei's next appointment is with Noho Dimittis of the Iron Bank. Cersei tries to pass him off to Lord Gyles, but the man has already seen him six times. Cersei suggests he see Gyles again, and Noho is not pleased. Cersei dismisses him abruptly, ordering Ser Meryn to escort him out and Ser Osmund to take her back to her apartments. When she and Osmund are alone, she asks after Osney. He has failed to seduce Margaery as of yet. While she seems interested in him, she is never alone. Cersei promises that she will arrange for some private time between the two. As they cross the yard, they hear a cheer erupt as a squire rides against a quintain. Margaery and her ladies are present, and Cersei realizes that the squire was actually Tommen. Ser Loras helps him down from his horse, and several members of the audience, including Osney and Ser Dermot, offer compliments. Margaery kisses him and compliments him as well, echoed by Megga, Alla, and Elinor. Lady Alysanne is also present. Cersei makes her presence known, and the mirth dies. Septa Nysterica bows first, and soon they are all bowing save Loras and Margaery. Tommen continues to be proud, and Cersei tells him he will be a great jouster one day like his father. Margaery asks what tournaments his father won, and Cersei realizes that she misspoke; Robert was an indifferent jouster, while Jaime was the brilliant one. She makes up a tournament and asks Ser Loras to walk with her before Margaery can reply. She is upset that Tommen rode against the quintain and wants to know who is responsible. Ser Loras says it was Margaery's idea and that he showed Tommen how to hold the lance. Cersei rebukes him, saying the master-at-arms is responsible for training, and Loras points out that the Red Keep has not had a master-at-arms since Ser Aron died. Ser Loras thinks he is right for the job, but Cersei does not want Tommen growing close to him. Cersei leaves him and returns to her quarters. On the way, she decides that she will send to Dorne for a new master-at-arms.
Lord Qyburn is waiting in Cersei's room when she arrives. He has reports for her. The Archon of Tyrosh has offered terms to Lys to end the current trade war. Myr was about to enter the war on the side of Tyrosh, but the Golden Company breaking their contract dissuaded them. Qyburn also reports that the slave revolt in Astapor has spread to Meereen and that there are reports of dragons, but Cersei is not interested in what goes on so far away from Westeros. There is also news from Dorne. Ser Daemon Sand was imprisoned for asking Doran to release the Sand Snakes, while Sylva Santagar was suddenly betrothed and married to Lord Eldon Estermont. Both Daemon and Sylva are close to Arianne. Finally, there is a puppet show being performed in which the beasts are ruled by a pride of haughty lions who become greedy and devour a stag when he objects. At the end of the play, a dragon hatches from an egg and eats the lions. Cersei is not amused and orders the show watched. Any men of worth attending will lose half their coffers, while any too poor to pay will lose an eye and the puppeteers will be executed. Qyburn asks if he can have the women for his experiments. Cersei snaps that she already gave him Senelle, but he replies that she is quite ""exhausted."" Cersei thinks back to when she took Senelle down to the dungeons and how she was uneasy about the foul thing screaming in the darkness.1 Cersei gives Qyburn leave to take a woman or two for the experiments. Qyburn leaves and Dorcas prepares a bath for Cersei. After she gets in the tub, Jaime comes in with Tommen and sends Dorcas and Jocelyn away. Tommen wants his white courser for his jousting lesson on the morrow. Cersei says he will not ride until they have a new master-at-arms, and Tommen replies that he wants Loras to teach him. Tommen becomes imperious and demands kittens and exemption from eating beets as well. Cersei takes him in hand and tells him that he will not learn from Loras. Tommen, defeated, asks if he can still have a kitten, and Cersei says yes as long as she hears no more about jousting. Tommen leaves and Jaime calls Cersei a fool before taking his leave as well. Cersei dresses for dinner and then joins Falyse and her husband, Ser Balman. She wishes that she were supping with Taena instead, as she is the best friend she has had since Melara Hetherspoon proved herself false and then drowned. Cersei asks after Lady Tanda, and it turns out she has broken her hip in a riding accident. Cersei thinks she will be dead soon.2 Cersei asks after their journey, which was not pleasant. They had thought to stay the night at Rosby, but Lord Gyles's ward refused to let them in. Furthermore, there were all manner of filthy armed men, some displaying the pointed star of the Seven, on the road. Cersei says they are sparrows and that the new High Septon must deal with them when he is chosen. Falyse is surprised that no one has been picked yet, and Cersei explains that Ollidor was almost chosen before a group of sparrows followed him to a brothel and dragged him out into the streets naked. Now it appears Luceon will be chosen, but he is still a few votes shy. Ser Balman wants to assure Cersei that he and Falyse had nothing to do with the naming of Lollys's bastard, and Cersei gets to the reason she invited them. She says she lives in fear of Tyrion and thinks that Bronn may be hiding him. Bronn has taken four knights into his household, and Cersei lies that she thinks he is preparing to move against her at Tyrion's behest. She intimates to Balman that Bronn should suffer a fatal accident and soon. Dinner goes past midnight, after which she checks on Tommen. She is surprised to find he has three black kittens. Ser Meryn explains that Margaery is responsible; she meant to give him one, but he could not decide which he liked best. She thinks black an ill color and how Rhaenys had a black cat and was killed. This leads her to think about how Rhaenys could have been hers, but that Aerys II refused Tywin. Cersei had been ten when she first saw Rhaegar, when he and Aerys came to Casterly Rock. A great tournament was held in his honor, and he bested many a fine knight. Genna confided in Cersei that at the end of the tournament a feast would be held and Cersei's betrothal to Rhaegar would be announced. She had been giddy at the prospect, which is why she agreed to go with Jeyne and to the tent of Maggy the Frog. Jeyne fled in fear, but Cersei and Melara stayed to let her taste their blood and deliver prophecies, which made little sense. There was no feast at the end. Tywin proposed the match, and Aerys rejected it, saying that while Tywin was his ablest servant, he did not intend to marry his son to a servant's daughter. Cersei has never forgiven Robert for killing him.","Ser Hyle insists they take the heads of Shagwell, Pyg, and Timeon with them as he, Brienne, and Podrick make their way back to Maidenpool. They present the heads to Lord Randyll upon their return. Lord Randyll wants to send her back to Tarth, but she is adamant about continuing her search for Sansa. She mentions that she may be with Sandor, and Randyll complains that he has hanged dozen of outlaws but has not been able to find their leaders, Sandor, Beric, Thoros, and a new leader, the woman called Stoneheart. Brienne asks for hospitality for the night, but Lord Randyll refuses and leaves. Ser Hyle tells Brienne to meet him at the Stinking Goose on the morrow. His cousin, Alyn, was one of those charged to look for Sandor, and Hyle will pick his brain for her. Brienne tries to find an inn for the night, but they are all full. Podrick suggests looking for a pallet on a ship, so they head to the docks. The Titan's Daughter is just casting off its lines, while the master of Gulltown Girl mistakes Brienne for a whore. At Seastrider, Brienne stops to buy an orange for Podrick. The ship is making for Gulltown next, and Brienne is tempted to seek passage, but decides that she must check out Sandor first. They finally find a berth on the storm-damaged Lady of Myr, where Brienne has a restless night dreaming of Dick, the men she killed, and other figures from her past. The next day, they head to the Goose, where Hyle meets them as promised. He says that Sandor was last seen heading west along the Trident after the raid on Saltpans.1 Hyle thinks he is probably still trapped in that general area. He also says that Beric is also looking for him and means to hang him for the raid of Saltpans. There is also a new band on the loose led by Lady Stoneheart. She is supposedly Beric's lover and was brought back to life by him with the kiss of fire after she was hanged by the Freys. Brienne decides that she will go to Saltpans to attempt to pick up Sandor's trail. Hyle says a traveling septon named Meribald is leaving on the morrow and will be stopping at Salptans, and he suggests they go with him. Brienne does not want Hyle around at first, but relents when she learns he has left Randyll's service and means to find Sansa for the reward. The next day, they head out northwest with Meribald, his dog, and a donkey laden with food for the poor. He takes them along the shore of the Bay of Crabs along a narrow road that often disappears in the reeds and tidal pools of the shoreline. They pass isolated houses built on stilts above the dunes. At one point, they come across three women who give them some clams in exchange for oranges. The next day, they see their first village. The people there warn them that there are three broken men skulking about in the area. Podrick asks what a broken man is, and Meribald explains that they are men that were marched off to war and broke in battle. They live from day to day and almost become subhuman in their quest for survival. Brienne asks when Meribald was marched off to war, and he talks of how he went to the Stepstones at Podrick's age to fight in the War of the Ninepenny Kings. His brothers went as well. William and Robin were both killed by fever, while Owen died from a mace blow and his friend Jon Pox was hanged for rape.","Sam looks out across the roofs of Braavos as the sun sets. Dareon was supposed to be back already and is probably drunk again. Gilly peeks out from behind her wild, unkempt hair and says that Dareon prefers to stay where there is wine and smiles. Dareon spends all his time with the bravos and courtesans now and is trying to write a song about a courtesan called the Moonshadow who rewarded his singing with a kiss. At times, he plays in the room and wakes the baby, storming out afterwards in anger and not returning for days at a time. The Titan sounds nightfall, waking the baby, which in turn wakes Maester Aemon. The maester's wits have been wandering more and more of late, and it takes him a moment to remember where he is. He is very sick. Sam used the last of their coin on a healer who gave him some dreamwine and said nothing could be done for him. Maester Aemon wants to go down to the ships to learn about the dragons, but Sam says he is too weak. This is not the first time they have had that argument. Aemon refuses to eat or drink anymore dreamwine, but he takes some water. He brings up the docks again, and tells Sam to go in his stead to find someone who has seen dragons. Dareon brought back the tale one night from the alehouses, but he was drunk and could not remember the details. Sam thinks he probably just made it up, but Aemon is convinced there is truth to the story. Sam says he would not know where to begin and that Aemon can go when he is stronger. Aemon points out that he will never get stronger, nor see Oldtown again. he says he has been kept alive for a purpose; he still remembers dragons. The last ones died before he was born, but he dreams of them just as his brothers once did. He says they are nearing an era of prophecy, of wonder and terror. He realizes he should have stayed at the Wall, because the cold was preserving him, but it is too late now, and he needs Sam to learn of the dragons. Sam goes out into the night and checks many of the inns near Ragman's harbor, including the Inn of the Green Eel, the Black Bargeman, the Foghouse, the Outcast Inn, and the House of Seven Lamps. Outside a brothel called Cattery's, he bumps into two men, bravos named Terro and Orbelo. Terro speaks to him in Braavosi. The other translates the insult into the Common Tongue. They think he is dressing above his station, as lords in Braavos wear somber colors such as black. A girl joins the conversation and tells them he is of the Night's Watch and that another member of the Watch is singing to the Sailor's Wife at the Happy Port. Arya gets the bravos to leave and offers Sam the last of her clams. She asks what he is doing there, and he explains that they are bound for Oldtown. Sam asks who she is, and she responds her name is Cat and gives her fake back story. She asks what ship they are sailing on, and Sam tells her it is the Lady Ushanora. This confuses Arya, as that ship sailed days ago. Sam was able to convince him to wait for Maester Aemon to recover his strength for three days, but after that he sailed without them and kept their coin. Arya repeats that Dareon is at the Happy Port about to ""marry"" the Sailor's Wife, a whore who only beds those who marry her. Sam takes off for the brothel. When he arrives, a one-eyed whore named Yna accosts him until Dareon calls her off. Dareon is drunk and has already ""married"" the Sailor's Wife, though the marriage lasts only the night. Sam asks Dareon to help him find out about dragons, but he refuses to do it until the morrow. Sam says they are brothers, and Dareon takes his cloak off of the Sailor's Wife's shoulders and throws it at Sam, saying he is through with the Watch. Sam hits him and then tackles and pummels him. Someone pulls him off Dareon, so he hits that man too and ends up tossed in the canal. He sinks to the bottom and nearly drowns, but a Summer Islander named Xhondo who had been in the brothel pulls him out. He is mate on the Cinnamon Wind, and he has seen the dragons.","Jaime is meeting with Cersei. She insults his beard, which contains some grey hairs, and tells him he is a pale, crippled thing. Jaime still wants her, but he cannot stop thinking about how Tyrion told him she is sleeping around. He says he will shave if she rescinds the order she has given him. She asks if he is a coward, and he replies that he had taken an oath to never again take up arms against Stark or Tully. Cersei is adamant about sending him to Riverrun to end the siege and dispense with Brynden Tully. She also needs him at Harrenhal, where Wylis is a captive and Gregor's men are not answering her ravens. Cersei informs him that Ser Osmund will command the Kingsguard in his absence. Jaime wants Loras, since Balon has been sent to Dorne, but Cersei will not hear of it. Jaime's escort waits in the stables: forty knights roughly evenly split between westermen and former enemies. They include Ser Dermot, Ser Ronnet, Ser Kennos, Ser Ilyn and three squires to attend him, Josmyn Peckledon, Garrett Paege, and Lew Piper. They ride out the gates of the city, where the main host waits. Ser Addam commands the outriders, Ser Steffon Swyft has the baggage train, Ser Bonifer commands his Holy Hundred, and Ser Flement has two hundred heavy horse. There are also mounted archers provided by House Sarsfield and Maester Gulian with four cages of ravens. Overall, he has less than a thousand men. Jaime rides at the head of the column with Ser Ilyn, whom Jaimes senses is glad to be with them. He had been the King's Justice for fifteen years; his appointment was a wedding present from Robert to Lord Tywin and compensation to Ser Ilyn for his lost tongue. While Ser Ilyn was a fearsome presence in that role, he is illiterate and was therefore unsuited to running the dungeons, a job he left to the Chief Gaoler. While his tower had rooms for the Chief Gaoler and the Lord Confessor, Ilyn lived alone, as there had not been a Lord Confessor since the reign of Daeron II and the last Chief Gaoler, a cloth maker who purchased the office from Lord Petyr during Robert's reign, was part of the Antler Man conspiracy and was flung over the walls with the rest by Joffrey. Therefore, it was Rennifer who conducted Jaime to see the King's Justice. His chambers were filthy and crawling with vermin; only his sword was kept immaculate. Jaime asked him to accompany his army, and Ser Ilyn finally nodded just as Jaime was preparing to leave. The first night, the party camps outside the castle of House Hayford. Jaime, Ser Ilyn, Ser Addam, Ser Bonifer, Ser Ronnet, Ser Lyle and a dozen others sup at the castle with Lady Ermesande's castellan. Lady Ermesande herself is trotted out at one point, but has to be carried out when she begins squalling. Jaime wears his new golden hand to the feast, which occasions must comment until he knocks over his goblet and lets his temper get the better of him. The castellan asks after Lord Tyrek, but he is still missing. Jaime thinks he must be dead by now. That night, he rethinks the issue and is not so sure. He thinks that it would be relatively simple to grab Tyrek during the riot if one knew what was going to happen. He thinks of Varys and how he always claimed to know what is going on in the city. He provided no warning of the riot and did not join the royal party that day.1 Jaime goes to get Ilyn and spars with him in the yard. Ilyn beats him handily, despite being rusty, but Jaime is determined to spar every night so he may learn to fight with his left hand.
The party continues on through the next several days, Jaime spending every night practicing with Ser Ilyn. Some of his captains must suspect what is going on, but they keep silent. Soon, it is possible to see the signs of war, burned crops and roads empty of travelers. They stop one night at the town of Sow's Horn, where Ser Roger Hogg is still encamped in his towerhouse with six men-at-arms, four crossbowmen, and twenty or so peasants. He tells of how Ser Amory came while he was harrying the Riverlands and killed half his sheep and tried to burn down the towerhouse. Later, wolves killed the other half of the flock. Karstark men also came looking for Jaime, but he killed three and drove the others off. Ser Roger asks what he should do, and the only answer Jaime can give him is to plant and hope for a harvest. The next day, they cross a stream that divides the Crownlands from the Riverlands and enter the territory of House Wode. Two brothers control the territory, but both their wooden halls are charred ruins and none of their smallfolk are about. One of the keeps holds a group of broken men, who Jaime hangs. They arrive at Harrenhal a few days later. The gates are barred, but open when Jaime announces the party's arrival. A few of Gregor's men file into the yard to greet them, including Shitmouth and Rafford. Shitmouth greets him with surprise and many a curse and is obviously drunk. Jaime has trouble getting the commander of the garrison's name out of him until he takes a spear from Beardless Jon Bettley and threatens to shove it up his arse, as Shitmouth has been saying ""fuck me with a bloody spear"" repeatedly. Shitmouth finally informs him that Polliver was castellan until Sandor killed him. Jaime asks why they did not pursue the Hound, and Raff speaks up that they are bad, but not stupid enough to face the Hound. Jaime tells Raff to gather the garrison and the captives and to show him Vargo's head. Jaime asks what happened to the rest of him, and they tell him that his limbs were cut off and his body fed to the prisoner's and Vargo himself. Jaime, disgusted, orders Josmyn to take it away. He tells the garrison that Ser Bonifer is to hold Harrenhal for the crown until Petyr takes up his seat there. Any man who wants to stay with him can, and the rest will go with him to Riverrun. Jaime goes to the dungeons to inspect the prisoners. No Brave Companions are left and only three residents of the castle; the cook who let Gregor in, Ben Blackthumb and Pia. The highborn prisoners have been mistreated as well, but there wounds are clean and they are alive. Their spirits have been broken, however, and when Jaime tells Ser Wylis he is being sent home, the man begins to sob on the floor in relief. Jaime sups with Ser Bonifer, a pious man fierce in his devotion to the Seven. He wants nothing to do with any of Gregor's men and wants Pia gone as well since she is a slut. Jaime agrees to take them with him. He asks if Bonifer will be able to hold his castle with just the Holy Hundred, who are actually only eighty-six strong due to fourteen losses on the Blackwater, and he is sure the Seven will help them hold. Maester Gulian is staying at Harrenhal as well. Jaime takes his leave after giving some final orders and goes to find Ser Ilyn for practice. He is surprised to find Ser Ronnet in the bearpit and goes to him. He is there to see the pit where Brienne fought. He explains how he was betrothed to her and rejected her and then mocks her as well, calling her a freak. Jaime slaps him with his golden hand and makes him say her name.","As Cersei rides in a carriage up Visenya's Hill with Taena, Ser Osmund rides ahead to make the people give way. Taena tells her that Margaery keeps a lively court of jugglers, mummers, poets, puppets, and singers. The singers include Hamish the Harper, Alaric of Eysen, and the Blue Bard. Cersei remembers the Blue Bard from Tommen's wedding and wonders whether he might be intimate with Margaery. She asks if Margaery is still a virgin, and Taena replies that the queen claims she is, but Taena is not so sure. There are many household knights who frequent her chambers as well, including Ser Horas and Ser Hobber, Ser Tallad, Ser Lambert, Ser Bayard Norcross, Ser Courtenay Greenhill, Ser Portifer Woodwright, and Ser Lucatine Woodwright. Grand Maester Pycelle is also a frequent visitor, as is Jalabhar Xho. Others call on her cousins as well, but Ser Loras comes most frequently of all, every morning and night. Cersei is on her way to see the new High Septon, who is one of the sparrows. The carriage suddenly stops as Ser Osmund roars for a group of people to make way. Cersei calls over Ser Meryn, who explains that a group of sparrows is blocking the way. The High Septon has refused to bless Tommen, probably because Cersei has stopped payment of the crown's debt to the Faith. Septons Torbert and Raynard had been very understanding before the new High Septon was chosen, unlike Noho, who hounded Lord Gyles so fiercely that he has taken to his bed. Still, Cersei is determined to have her dromonds so that she does not have to depend on House Redwyne for naval support. The flagship, Lord Tywin, will dip eight hundred oars, to be followed by Sweet Cersei, Brave Joffrey, Lady Joanna, Lioness, Queen Margaery, Golden Rose, Lord Renly, Lady Olenna, and Princess Myrcella. The last five were named by Tommen, who wanted to name the Princess Myrcella after Moon Boy until Aurane suggested that men might not like serving on a ship named after a fool. The carriage has still not resumed moving, and Cersei peaks out, only to behold hundreds of sparrows encamped on the path to the Great Sept. Ser Osmund rides up with Ser Osfryd, who now commands the city watch. Pycelle led the small council in disapproving of the choice and demanding a more seasoned commander, but Cersei would not be dissuaded. Cersei decides she will walk the rest of the way. The sparrows stare at her sullenly as she passes. She is appalled to see that the statue of Baelor is covered waist-deep in bones. One of the sparrows explains that they are the bones of those who have been killed for the Faith. Cersei promises that they will be avenged, but the sparrows want the crown to defend the Faith and for all true knights to forsake their worldly masters for the faith. At the entrance to the sept, a group of armed men bar her way. She is surprised Raynard and Torbert are not there to fawn over her. The leader of the guard tells Osmund and Meryn to remove their swordbelts to enter. They refuse, and Cersei defuses the situation by having them wait outside and entering alone.
Inside, she sees many men on their hands and knees cleaning. She mistakes them for sparrows, until Septon Raynard raises his head. Cersei is appalled, as the High Septon gets up from the floor and says that hard work is a form of prayer. She asks where Torbert is and learns that he has been confined to a penitent's cell and placed on a diet of bread and water since it is not right for a man to be so plump when so many are starving. Cersei is furious that he did not meet her on the steps in his finest robes with his crown in his head. He explains that he sold the crown and all the other treasure of the Faith to purchase food for the poor. Cersei thinks he must be mad and wonders how the Most Devout could chose him. Qyburn reported that Luceon had been nine votes short when the sparrows had broken down the doors of the sept and filed in with their leader on their shoulders and axes in their hands. Cersei asks whether they may speak in private, and he leads her into the sept proper, where they kneel before the Crone as they confer. She tells him the sparrows must leave and go back whenever they came, but the High Septon says they have no homes. He was a traveling septon before joining the sparrows, and many of the towns he ministered to are gone. Cersei blames northmen and outlaws for the work, but the High Septon does not care who was responsible, only that the king did not defend the Faith, as Jaehaerys I promised he always would. Cersei asks why Tommen has not been blessed, and the High Septon says the hour is not ripe. He says that he must not exalt one king above the other claimants to the throne without being sure. When Aegon the Conqueror landed three hundred years ago, the High Septon at the time prayed and fasted in the Starry Sept in Oldtown for seven days and seven nights and then emerged to say that the Faith would not oppose Aegon so that Oldtown would not be destroyed. Lord Banfred Hightower held back his strength on the word of the High Septon and opened his gates when Aegon came, after which the High Septon anointed him with the seven oils. The High Speton says he must pray and fast too. Cersei points out that the other claimants to the throne worship false gods, but the High Septon retorts that Tommen does not defend the Faith. Cersei says he has not the men and that they should defend themselves. It has been forbidden for the Faith to take up arms since King Maegor suppressed the militant orders of the Sword and Star, but Cersei says she will undo the laws if Tommen is blessed. She also asks that the Faith forgive the crown's debt of nine hundred thousand six hundred and seventy-four dragons. The High Septon agrees to bless Tommen and forgive the debt in exchange for the repeal of Maegor's laws. On the way back to the Red Keep, Cersei and Taena drink hippocras to celebrate her triumph over the Faith. They meet Margaery's party on the way, consisting of the queen, Alla, Megga, Elinor, Janna, Meredyth, Alyn, Tallad, Mark, Horas, Hobber, Lambert, Jalabhar Xho, the Blue Bard, and Loras. Margaery never goes more than three days without riding off somewhere and often rides through the city garnering the adulation of the common folk. She wants Tommen to go on these trips too, but Cersei will not allow it. It suddenly occurs to Cersei that Olenna had wanted to marry Sansa to Willas and suddenly thinks that they all conspired along with Tyrion to murder Joffrey, who was too strong for Margaery's charms to work, and then paid the gaoler to free Tyrion then whisked him and Sansa to safety at Highgarden. Margaery says the queen should go with her on her trips, but she declines. She thinks of how Robert would always try to get her to go hunting with him, but she begged off to have time with Jaime. It suddenly occurs to her that Margaery might be going off into the woods to make love to Loras, and decides to use that against her.","Drums pound as the Iron Victory passes by a ship bearing the sigils of House Serry and House Tyrell, snapping the oars. Victarion leaps onto the deck of the enemy ship alone and begins laying his axe into those who charge him, most of whom are not armored like him. Soon, members of his crew join him, including Wulfe One-Ear, Ragnor Pyke, and Nute the Barber. Victarion spies the captain of the ship, Ser Talbert Serry, and moves to engage. The boy is quick, but Victarion finally grabs his sword and throws it into the sea, and then sends Ser Talbert into the water to follow it into the depths. Victarion and his men soon secure the vessel. They have smashed the Serry fleet, with only a dozen longships retreating up the Mander. Victarion asks if anyone pulled Ser Talbert out of the water, but he has drowned. He names Ragnor to command the captured ship and returns to Iron Victory. Victarion is bitter, because his victory will be credited to Euron even though he sat out the battle at Oakenshield. Victarion goes below decks and has sex with the dusky woman waiting for him there and then reflects on the victory as the woman dresses his hand wound.
The plan was devised by Euron. In older days, the ironmen had raided up the Mander as far as Bitterbridge, looting and plundering. That ended when the kings of the Reach armed the fisherfolk on the four islands at the mouth of the river and made them his shields. The fortresses of Greenshield, Greyshield, Oakenshield, and Southshield along with their attendant watchtowers have guarded the Mander for the last two thousand years. Euron sent Torwold and the Red Oarsman up the Mander with a dozen longships to draw out the defenders from the islands and then brought his main force in on the evening tide to mask it from the watchtowers as long as possible. Greyshield, Greenshield, and Southshield all fell that night, and Oakenshield had fallen by noon the next day. The battle just concluded was against the main strength of the islands that had finally broken off their pursuit of the decoys. There are whispers that Euron was aided to his victory by wizards. Quellon Humble has told Victarion that he has three of them aboard Silence as slaves.
Victarion drinks wine and broods over Euron. He considers killing his brother, but fears the curse the Drowned God levies on any man who kills his kin. He wonders if it would just be okay to order someone else to do the deed and wishes Aeron was there to advise him, but his brother is back in the Iron Islands attempting to raise opposition to Euron among the smallfolk so they might cast him down. Lord Baelor had attempted to deny Euron as his king as well and to depart Old Wyk, but the Iron Fleet had the bay sealed off, and Victarion dutifully delivered him to Euron, who had him cut into seven parts as a mockery to Baelor's worship of the Seven. It was as a reward for this and other services that Euron had gifted him the dusky woman, who had been taken off a slaving ship bound for Lys. Victarion had refused her at first, until Euron said the girl would otherwise be killed. Her tongue has been removed, but she is otherwise undamaged and beautiful.
The Iron Fleet gets under way for Oakenshield, with Iron Victory forming a rear guard with Grief, Lord Dagon, Iron Wind, and Maiden's Bane. The final tally from the battle shows that the Iron Fleet lost six ships, including Hardhand, while capturing thirty-eight. Victarion once again thinks of Euron and tells the dusky woman he should kill the man but fears to, and also laments that Asha did not support him. She and her crew fled the very night of the kingsmoot, and Victarion hopes that she marries some northern lord and stays far away from the sea. The fleet arrives at Lord Hewett's Town on Oakenshield, where Euron sits with his main strength. As they near the shore, Victarion sees a line of women and children being led onto a cog and asks one of the men at the docks what is going on. The man explains they are women and orphans to be sold as slaves, which infuriates Victarion, as while the ironmen take thralls and saltwives, they do not sell captives for gold. Victarion makes for the castle of House Hewett, which flies a Greyjoy kraken now. In the yard, he comes across Lord Gorold, Lord Dunstan, and Lord Rodrik conferring. Nute gloats that they are victorious and Rodrik's doubts were unfounded, but the three lords argue that the ironmen cannot hope to stand against the combined might of Highgarden, which is sure to descend upon them since Euron commanded that the ravens from Lord Hewett's Town be allowed to fly.
A large feast is underway as Victarion and Nute enter the castle, and Nute is angry that Euron's men, including Lucas, Quellon, Lord Germund, and Andrik have taken all the plunder and the women while the Iron Fleet was out fighting. Victarion does not care to feast near Euron, so he takes a seat next to Ralf the Limper. Hotho tells him that Ser Harras is to be lord of Greyshield. Ser Harras took Grimston by himself. He challenged the Grimms to fight him, and slew seven men one by one before the septon yielded the castle. The feast features many choice dishes, all served by Lord Hewett's wife and her seven daughters and good-daughters in all their finery. Lord Humfrey Hewett himself sits in his accustomed place, though he is tied to his chair and has a radish stuffed in his mouth. Euron sits at the place of honor on his right with the lord's bastard daughter, Falia, on his knee. Before Euron's arrival, she had been treated as a servant, and she relishes the opportunity to torment her family. At one point, she gets Euron to order the women to continue their serving duties naked. As the festivities continue, Euron announces the new lords of the Shields, who stand to receive recognition. Ser Harras is granted Greyshield, Andrik is given Southshield, Maron is granted Greenshield and Nute is granted Oakenshield. Victarion realizes that Euron has damaged all his main rivals at a stroke, as Nute is his right hand, Andrik is Lord Dunstan's right hand, Ser Harras is the chosen heir of Lord Rodrik, and Maron has the blood of House Hoare and could be used by Euron's enemies.
Euron leads a toast to the new lords of the Shields and then tells the assembled that they will soon set sail again for Slaver's Bay and dragons. Lord Rodrik objects, saying that the journey is too long and dangerous, and some voice agreement, including Ralf the Limper, Quellon Humble, Fralegg the Strong, Alvyn Sharp, and Red Ralf Stonehouse. They argue that the ironmen should just plunder Highgarden and the Arbor. Euron leaves the hall amid their shouts. Sometime after darkness, one of Euron's sons summons Victarion to Euron, who has taken Lord Humfrey's chambers. He laments the small dreams of the ironborn and how he can conquer the world with dragons. He had a dragon egg once, but the Myrish wizard who claimed he could hatch it failed and was executed and he threw it into the sea during a dark mood. He adds that Cragorn, the man who blew the dragon horn is dead and that his lungs were charred and black with soot. Euron offers Victarion some shade of the evening which he stole from a Qartheen ship. There were four warlocks on board as well; he killed one and fed him to the other three. They told him of Daenerys, whom he means to make his bride.1 He tells Victarion to take the Iron Fleet and bring her back. He promises to make Victarion king of the Iron Islands once he has the Iron Throne. Victarion agrees to do so, but means to take Daenerys for himself.","Jaime approaches Castle Darry with his host. Ser Addam had reported that the fields around the castle are being tilled once more, but everyone has fled inside the castle at his approach. The castle flies a standard quartering the Lannister lion with the Darry ploughman to represent that Lancel rules by right of marriage. Jaime has Ser Kennos sound the Horn of Herrock to announce their arrival and orders Ser Lyle to set up a fortified camp beneath the western wall of the castle. Jaime rides towards the castle with Ser Dermot carrying the royal standard and Ser Hugo carrying the standard of the Kingsguard. Ser Ronnet is no longer with the party: Jaime charged him with delivering Ser Wylis to Maidenpool to get a ship to take him back to White Harbor so that they would not have to see each other again. Behind him, Pia is saying to Josmyn that the castle looks like a toy, as she has known no other castle save Harrenhal. The castle has been burned once and sacked twice during the war, but the castle is already in the process of being repaired. The walls are patrolled by Lannister and Frey armsmen, and there are sparrows about as well. A Maester Ottomore meets Jaime at the gates and is surprised to see him, as they were not expected to come by Darry. Jaime asks if Kevan is there, but he left shortly after the wedding. Lord Lancel and Lady Amerei will hold a feast for Jaime and his chief knights that night. Jaime asks after Ser Harwyn as well, but he has ranged beyond the Trident with five knights and twenty archers to hunt outlaws. Lord Lancel is at his prayers.
As the maester leads Jaime to his quarters, Jaime comments on the bare walls. The maester explains that Lancel wants to replace them with scenes of piety and devotion. Jaime thinks back to how the walls were bare the first time he had come to Darry as well, with King Robert's party on the way to Winterfell. Tyrion had discovered the missing tapestries in a storeroom, portraits of all the Targaryen kings from Aegon I to Aerys II. Jaime is surprised to be led to the lord's apartments, and the maester explains that Lancel usually sleeps in the sept. Jaime takes a bath and dresses for dinner with the help of Josmyn, Lew, Garrett and Pia. Lady Amerei welcomes him at the feast, but Lancel is not there as he prefers to fast. The lady talks of how her first husband, Ser Pate died challenging Gregor Clegane when the Freys were still fighting for Robb, boasting that he was just the man to kill the Mountain. Jaime says he understands the sentiment, as he had wanted to kill the Smiling Knight. Amerei has never heard of him, but when Jaime explains he was an outlaw, she gets weepy. Her mother, Mariya, explains how her father, Merrett, was recently killed by outlaws. The talk turns from outlaws to wolves, and Ser Danwell states that there are more in the forest now than at anytime in memory. They have grown bold and no longer fear men; they attacked the Frey baggage train several times on its journey from the Twins and only stopped after a dozen had been killed.
Jaime looks out over his knights at the feast, including Ser Addam, Ser Steffon, Ser Kennos, Ser Dermot, and Ser Hugo, before inquiring whether Lord Beric's band killed Merrett. Lady Mariya says they believed so at first, but soon learned differently. The outlaws had scattered in several directions, Lord Lucias tracked a group as far as Fairmarket, but lost them there. Black Walder had more success in Hag's Mire, where he learned from the peasants that the outlaws had included a one-eyed man,1 a man in a yellow cloak,2 and a woman, hooded and cloaked.3 The woman supposedly has a horribly scarred face and eyes terrible to look upon and was the leader of the band. Lord Beric was apparently nowhere to be found. Black Walder was able to track them until they disappeared into the Neck. Lady Amerei implores Jaime to stay and deal with the outlaws, but he refuses. Ser Lyle says he will attend to them after they have dealt with Riverrun. He thinks it will be easy, but Ser Arwood cautions him that Beric will not stay dead and that now Sandor is with him, and slew twenty men at Saltpans.4 He explains how he, Ser Harys, and Ser Donnel rode to Saltpans with fifty men after the attack hoping to find Lord Beric's trail, but all they found was Ser Quincy locked in his tower and the whole town in ashes. Upon hearing this, Ser Lyle pledges that he will hunt down the Hound after Riverrun falls. Jaime knocks over his wine glass and takes his leave to find Lancel.
At the gate to the sept, three sparrows bar Jaime's entrance until Lancel comes out to bid him enter. He is thin and wears only a roughspun wool tunic. He has also shaved the crown of his head. Jaime asks if he has lost his mind, and he replies that he has found his faith. Ser Kevan left after they quarreled. Lancel bids Jaime to pray with him. He claims that he has had visions from the Seven. He has not eaten for some time. Jaime tells him that he should be making an heir with Amerei and that she lusts after Ser Harwyn and will sleep with him soon if she has not already. Lancel says he does not want the castle or his wife. Furthermore, the marriage was not consummated. He means to cast her aside, just as King Baelor cast aside his sister-wife Daena after he was crowned. Lancel says he has sinned, that he killed King Robert with a wineskin. He also admits that he has lain with Cersei. Jaime thinks back to how Cersei once told him that she had lied to him a thousand times. He thought he had just meant to hurt him, but now he wonders if that was the only time she ever told the truth. Lancel makes known his intent to ride to King's Landing on the morrow to pledge his sword to the Warrior's Sons. Lancel asks Jaime to pray with him once again, but Jaime says he has forgotten the words and leaves. Jaime seeks out Ser Ilyn and takes him to the godswood where they can practice in private. Jaime tells him how Cersei had wanted Arya to lose a hand after Joffrey was attacked by Nymeria, and that she argued with Robert half the night in the lord's bedchamber. After Robert had fallen into a drunken sleep, Jaime took Cersei on the bed with him only a few feet away. Cersei had cried out ""I want"" while they were having intercourse, and Jaime thought she wanted him, but now she thinks all she had been thinking about was taking Arya's hand. Ser Ilyn laughs at him, and Jaime angrily tells him to come kill him if he can.","Brienne gazes out at the Quiet Isle, set in the middle of the Trident where it widens before emptying into the Bay of Crabs. Meribald tells her that the brothers will ferry them over to Saltpans on the morning tide and that they should stay at the monastery for the night. Podrick asks why it is called the Quiet Isle, and Meribald explains that the brothers have taken a vow of silence, and that only the Elder Brother and his proctors are permitted to speak, though the proctors may only speak on one day out of every seven. Meribald leads them on a twisted path through the mudflats that surround the island. One of the proctors, Brother Narbert greets Meribald when they reach the island, and Meribald introduces Brienne, Podrick, and Ser Hyle. Narbert is surprised to see a woman, and even more troubled when Brienne tells him she is hunting Sandor. He says he should take them to the Elder Brother at once. They stop at the stables to leave their horses with a Brother Gillam, and Hyle is surprised to see a spirited black horse on one stall. The animal is named Driftwood, and it has been nothing but trouble. It kicked Brother Rawney when he tried harnessing the beast to a plow and bit off Brother Gillam's ear when he tried to geld the beast. They walk up the hill, and come to a lichyard near the top where a large, lame brother is digging a grave. The grave is for Brother Clement, who died at Saltpans during the raid. Brienne asks if it was Sandor, but Narbert says that it was not and that the Elder Brother can tell them more. At the top of the hill is a sept and a wooden door set into a hillside. The cave with the door is the Hermit's Hole, where the first holy man to find the island lived around two thousand years ago according to legend.
The inside of the cave has been turned into a snug inner sanctum, and the Elder Brother greets them there. He is courteous, but clearly troubled when he learns that Brienne and Ser Hyle seek the Hound. He is happy to see Meribald, and hopes that he will hear their sins since the septon of Saltpans, Bennet, was killed in the raid. Ser Hyle asks if the sept was burned, and the Elder Brother explains that the whole town was burned save the castle. Many women were not only raped, but had their breasts torn and eaten as well.1 Ser Quincy barred his gates and did nothing to stop the carnage, though he did not have the strength necessary to make much of a difference. They eat dinner with the brothers, and afterwards, the Elder Brother leads Brienne to her quarters. He tells her that one used to be able to see the fires of Saltpans from the hill, but no one is left now. The fishermen that survived buried their friends and kin and moved on to other towns. Saltpans was never an important port, but ships did call occasionally, which is why the raiders were there. When no ship was to be found, they took out their rage on the town. The Elder Brother asks Brienne what she hopes to find in Saltpans, and she says she is looking for a highborn maid of thirteen with auburn hair. The Elder Brother recognizes this as Sansa and asks if she thinks the girl is with the Hound. When Brienne says she does, he says they must talk. He explains that it was not Sansa that was with Sandor, but Arya. She was with him at the Old Crossroads Inn, but that he does not know what happened after that. He also reports that the Hound is dead. He buried Sandor himself, and left his helmet on top of the grave as a marker. Someone else2 stole the helm and wore it during the raid at Saltpans. The Elder Brother came upon Sandor, dying, who begged him for the gift of mercy. Sworn not to kill, all he could do was tend to Sandor's wounds, but he was unable to save him. The horse in the stable, now named Driftwood, is actually Stranger. He talks of how he himself was a knight, the third son of a knight who fought on the Trident for Rhaegar. He was seriously wounded in the battle, looted, and left for dead, but he washed up on the Quiet Isle, became a brother, and spent the next ten years in silence. He implores her to give up her quest and go home, but she says she cannot. Her entire life story pours out of her then, all the hardships she has faced. She says she promised Jaime that she would save Sansa and that she must succeed or die in the attempt.","Margaery and Loras stand before Cersei in the throne room, who is guarded by Ser Boros, Ser Meryn, and Ser Osmund and attended by Pycelle, Aurane, Qyburn, Ser Harys, and Lord Orton. Margaery is reporting on the attack on the Shield Islands and demanding action. Reports put the ironman numbers at one thousand ships, but even at half that number the only fleet that could match them is the Redwyne fleet. Ser Harys inquires after the new dromonds, but only half are fitted out and none are fully crewed. Cersei wonders what has emboldened the ironmen, as they have not raided the reach since Dagon Greyjoy ruled them, and Qyburn says it is because of Euron. Lord Humfrey Hewett and Lord Moribald Chester are dead, Lord Guthor Grimm is a prisoner, and Lord Osbert Serry has fled to Highgarden. Cersei thinks that Euron might have made an alliance with Stannis. Pycelle thinks this is ridiculous, but the other councilors are quick to agree with her. Cersei decides that the Reach should deal with this problem, and Margaery agrees. Willas has sent word to Lord Leyton warning him to prepare his defenses, and Garlan is gathering men. The main Tyrell strength is with Lord Mace at Storm's End, however, and the siege must be lifted at once. Cersei refuses to do this and tells Margaery that Highgarden must manage with what they have. Loras says they can do nothing without warships, and asks for the Redwyne fleet. This force of two hundred warships and a thousand carracks, cogs, galleys and whalers is currently divided between ferrying men to Dragonstone and besieging Storm's End from the sea, and Cersei refuses to release them before Dragonstone is taken. Cersei declares the audience at an end, but Ser Loras comes forward and asks to take command of the siege of Dragonstone, promising to deliver the castle in a fortnight. Cersei grants him leave to do so, and gives him the use of the new dromond Sweet Cersei to ferry him to the island.
Cersei leaves the throne room with Pycelle and Qyburn. Pycelle is not happy with her decision, but she is so pleased that she has to laugh aloud. She decides that Pycelle has outlived his usefulness, as he never does anything but raise objections and cautions to her every move. He even protested the rearming of the Faith until she finally shut him up. After Pycelle takes his leave, Qyburn says that Cersei will need another knight for the Kingsguard should Loras fall. Cersei asks if he has anyone in mind, and he says there is one that would protect her from her enemies, keep her secrets, and be able to stand against any man.1 Qyburn goes on to ask about the armor he requested, and Cersei says she has placed the order, but the armorer says no man could fight in such a weight of plate. Cersei returns to her room, where Lady Taena sleeps in her bed. Cersei has never liked sleeping alone and has made Taena a companion of late. As she looks at Taena lying there, she wonders what it might be like to kiss another woman. She thinks of Robert and how he abused her. He would drink too much wine and have rough sex with her while he was drunk that would leave her in pain. The only night she was ever aroused by him was their wedding night. Later, he would pretend not to remember what happened. Once in the first year of their marriage, Cersei told him how he had hurt her. He looked ashamed, blamed it on the wine, and reached for his ale. Cersei responded by smashing her horn of ale into his face hard enough to chip a tooth. Afterwards, Robert always claimed he chipped it in a melee.
A knock interrupts her reverie. It is a guardsman reporting that Lady Falyse has requested an audience. Cersei wants to refuse her, but the guardsman says she is in an awful state, so Cersei dresses and goes to see her. Falyse is bruised and sobbing when Cersei arrives. Ser Balman is dead. He challenged Bronn to single combat, figuring he could unhorse the sellsword and finish him while he was stunned. Bronn impaled Balman's horse instead, and his legs were crushed in the fall. When Falyse ran to him, Bronn hit her. He makes Balman confess and then puts his dagger in Balman's eye. He tells Falyse to leave if she does not want the same, and the garrison sided with him. She did not even have time to gather up her clothes, which Bronn said were forfeited to Lollys. Bronn is the lord of Stokeworth now. Cersei asks if Balman named her, and Falyse confirms that he did. Falyse is worried for Lady Tanda, who may be dead already. Cersei gets her drunk and then sends Dorcas to bring Qyburn and Jocelyn to bring food and wine. When Qyburn arrives, Cersei asks if he still needs women for his experiments, which he does, as the puppeteers are used up. Cersei gives him Falyse, and Qyburn takes her away to the black cells. Taena is asleep when she returns. She decides to play with the other woman's breasts, which awakens Taena, who seems to like the attention. She twists Taena's nipples until they hurt, but when Taena protests, Cersei blames the wine. Taena is aroused, and Cersei pleasures her, but gets no joy out of it herself. When Taena tries to return the favor, Cersei rolls out of bed and decides to pretend it never happened.","Trumpets pierce the air at dusk, and Josmyn automatically goes for Jaime's swordbelt. Jaime assures him that outlaws would not blow trumpets and that Ser Daven Lannister, Warden of the West, must have arrived. Jaime comes out of his tent to greet him and leads him into the tent, where Garret has lit the braziers, Lew takes Daven's cloak and Pia prepares some wine. Jaime asks what to expect at Riverrun. Daven reports that the siege is dragging on with neither side engaging the other in combat. Daven is particularly irritated by the Frey contingent. Ser Ryman is usually drunk, his son Edwyn is full of hate, and Lord Emmon keeps trying to tell him how to run the siege and to avoid damaging Riverrun since it is now his seat. He is fed up with Walder Rivers as well, but Ser Perwyn is amiable enough. Daven is to marry a Frey by an agreement made by Lord Tywin. Jaime tells him that Lancel dissolved his marriage and left Castle Darry to pledge his sword to the Faith. Daven says that Ser Kevan passed through on his way back west, and he wishes Kevan had stayed, as the Freys would not vex him so. Ryman has raised a gibbet and puts a noose around Edmure's neck every day and threatens to hang him. Ser Brynden is not swayed, so every night he is taken down again. Roslin is pregnant with Edmure's child, and Emmon wants Edmure executed immediately. Lord Gawen is with the army as well, and beseeches him to make sure Edmure is not hanged, as his wife and children are in the castle and he fears they will be killed in retaliation. The castle is encircled by three camps. Ser Ryman commands the Freys north of the Tumblestone, Lord Emmon is with Ser Forley and the remains of Jaime's host from the original siege as well as the Riverlords that have returned to the fold south of the Red Fork, and Daven himself is between the rivers and faces the main gates. There is also a boom across the Red Fork downstream from Riverrun to prevent resupply by water manned by Ser Manfryd Yew and Ser Raynard Ruttiger. Starving out the castle is not an option, as it is well provisioned and many of Daven's foraging parties do not return thanks to outlaws and Stark loyalists. Fires are being lit all around them every night, and many towns now light fires in worship of the Lord of Light. Jaime asks if there has been a parlay, and Daven replies that Ryman rode up to the gates once making threats, and Ser Brynden sent him on his way by putting an arrow in the rump of his horse. Jaime means to try again and offer generous terms so that he does not have to take up arms against House Tully.
Jaime goes out among the tents to mingle with the men, who have always been comfortable around him. He gives a young knight advice on how to defend against a warhammer and watches as Raff and another man hoisting half-naked washerwomen on their shoulders to joust with rolled up cloaks. Finally, he finds Ser Ilyn and goes off to train with him. Once again, it ends with Jaime bruised and humiliated. The next day, they reach the environs of Riverrun. Jaime can see the camps surrounding it. Ryman's is the biggest and most disorganized. Daven explains that he has given his men whores, cock fights, and boar baiting to keep them entertained and also has a singer. Lady Genna brought Whitesmile Wat with her from Lannisport, so Ryman had to have a singer too.1 Jaime beholds the castle, which still flies Tully and Stark banners, and thinks of the first time he went to the castle with Sumner Crakehall. Hoster had tried to interest him in Lysa, but all Jaime had cared about was talking to Brynden, who had gained renown through his service in the War of the Ninepenny Kings. They have to pass through Emmon's camp on the way to Daven's. Jaime sees the banners of Lychester, Vance, Roote, Goodbrook, Smallwood, and Piper, but is disturbed not to see any from Mallister, Bracken, Ryger, or Paege, all of which supposedly renewed their fealty. The Brackens are busy fighting the Blackwoods, but he feels the others should be there. He feels the siege must end quickly; else the others may be tempted to renew the fighting. As they reach Daven's camp, Ser Kennos sounds his horn to announce their arrival, and Ser Dermot and Ser Hugo go before Jaime carrying his standards. Jaime sees two completed siege towers and a ram, with a third tower under construction. He orders Ser Addam to inspect the perimeter defenses and sends Ser Jon with a peace banner to request a parlay.
Jaime sets up his tent, and soon his Aunt Genna comes to greet him with Ser Emmon in tow. Genna offers condolences for Tywin's death and is shocked to learn that Tyrion really did do the deed. She asks after Cleos as well, and Jaime lies that he scattered the outlaws before he died. Emmon brings up the siege engines and tells Jaime that Riverrun must not be harmed. Emmon says he means to be fair with his new vassals and is not pleased when Jaime points out that he was only granted the castle and Lord Petyr is the Lord Paramount of the Trident. Genna is disappointed that they were granted Riverrun instead of Darry, as Cleos's wife, Jeyne, is a Darry and the male line is extinguished unlike the Tully line. She thinks Kevan should have been granted Riverrun instead and laments that Tywin never consulted with her. Jaime tells her about Lancel, but she is not concerned, as Kevan can marry Martyn to Amerei and still keep the castle. She is furious with Cersei though for reviving the militant orders of the Faith. After Aegon I died, there was a large rebellion against Targaryen rule that the Faith was right in the middle of. Maegor ended up putting a bounty of one dragon on each Warrior's Son and one silver stag for each Poor Fellow. The rebellion only ended after Maegor's death when Jaehaerys agreed to pardon all those who put down their swords. Genna asks what Jaime means to do, and he says he will offer terms. She does not think that will work and thinks they should execute Edmure. She tells Jaime to do what Tywin would have done. Jaime asks if Genna loved Tywin. She tells him that she was seven when Lord Tytos betrothed her to Emmon. It was a poor match, but Tytos was his father's thirdborn son and was always looking to please his elders. He made the match just to please Lord Walder. The announcement was made before half the west. Lady Ellyn laughed and Lord Reyne stormed out of the hall angrily. No one else dared speak against the match save Tywin, a boy of ten. He was her big brother and protected her; now there is no one to protect them. Jaime says he left a son, and she replies that is what she fears most. Jaime has some of Tygett in him, some of Gerion, and even some of Kevan, but Tyrion was his only true son.","Arya wakes up and gets out of the bed she shares with Brusco's daughters, Talea and Brea. The three of them get dressed and then pile onto Brusco's boat. As the boat wends its way to the fishmarket, Arya tries to recall her dream from the night before. She thinks she had the wolf dream again, which still comes to her often. She also frequently dreams she is searching for her mother in a rainy wasteland, but a monster with a dog's head always prevents Arya from finding her. Once they arrive at the market, Brusco examines the morning catch and instructs the others on which ones to haul back to his boat. Once this is finished, they cast off again. Arya always keeps a lookout for new things she can learn, as she is commanded to return to the temple three days out of every thirty and tell the Kindly Man three new things she learned since last she left the temple. For example, one evening she tells him she knows what Blind Beqqo puts in his hot sauce, that the mummers at the Blue Lantern are performing The Lord of Woeful Countenance and the mummers at the Ship are answering with Seven Drunken Oarsmen, and that the bookseller Lotho Lornel sleeps in the house of Captain Moredo Prestayn when the captain is at sea. Afterwards, he always asks who she is. She answers ""no one,"" but the Kindly Man knows she considers herself Cat of the canals. Three days of every thirty, she must serve at the temple, the rest of the time she works for Brusco.
When the boat returns to the house, Arya helps Brusco's sons and daughters unload the shellfish. Afterwards, Brusco divides them between Arya, Talea, and Brea, and tells them not to return until all the shellfish are sold. Brea sells hers at the Purple Harbor, Talea plies the Moon Pool area and the Isle of the Gods, and Arya sells hers at Ragman's harbor. Arya loves the sights, sounds and smells of the harbor, and enjoys mingling with the sailors too. She often uses insulting words and phrases, which occasionally makes someone angry, but Red Roggo, a frequent patron of the Happy Port, once showed her how to use a knife and carry it up her sleeve. Other denizens of the docks have taught her other things as well. Gyloro Dothare taught her filthy songs, his brother Gyleno told her the best place to catch eels, the mummers of the Ship instructed her in acting and parts of speeches from plays such as The Song of the Rhoyne, The Conqueror's Two Wives, and The Merchant's Lusty Lady, and Cossomo the Conjuror taught her sleight of hand. Quill, the makeup artist for the mummers of the Ship, wanted to instruct her in kissing, but Tagganaro quickly put a stop to that.
Arya sells her clams on five new ships that have just docked; a carrack called the Brazen Monkey, an Ibbanese whaler, two battered cogs from Pentos, and a galley from Volantis. The mate on the galley tells her that the ship captain had been killed when the pirate Salladhor Saan tried to board them near the Stepstones from Valyrian and Old Mother's Son. The Brazen Monkey is out of Gulltown, and Arya tells a sailor named Wat where to find the best whores. Many of the dockside whores in Braavos can be dangerous. S'vrone has robbed and killed at least a dozen men, the Drunken Daughter gets nasty when drunk, and Canker Jeyne is really a man. Meralyn runs the Happy Port and has a big heart, and her girls, Bethany, the Sailor's Wife, Yna, Lanna, and Assadora are all nice as well. Another lad asks about getting a courtesan, but only the highborn can afford them. They are beautiful women much sought after as lovers. They each have their own barge and keep an air of mystery about themselves. Some of the more famous courtesans include the Poetess, the Moonshadow, the Merling Queen, and the Veiled Lady, but the most famous and beautiful of them all is the Black Pearl. She is reputedly descended from Targaryen stock. The original Black Pearl, also named Bellegere like the current one, was reputedly a pirate queen that was taken as a lover by a Westerosi prince. Her daughter became the first Black Pearl courtesan, and each daughter has been the Black Pearl in turn until the present day. The sailors give Arya news from Gulltown, including Lysa's death. As Arya continues down the docks, she comes across Taggnaro with his seal, Casso. He asks her to come and work for him, as he has been looking for a new cutpurse since Little Narbo got stabbed in the hand by the Drunken Daughter.
Arya ends at the Happy Port, where she sells to several mummers from the Ship, including Joss the Gloom and Myrmello. They are down two actors, as Quence caught Allaquo in bed with another member of the troop, Sloey, and both men left. When she enters the brothel, she is angered to see Dareon there, singing a love song to Merry, Yna, and Lanna. She is angry that he is in Braavos flirting with all the girls because he is a man of the Night's Watch who has forsworn his duty. The Sailor's Wife comes up and says he is fair to look upon, but Arya thinks he has a foul heart. The Sailor's Wife married him once, as she only takes those who ""marry"" her. There are often three or four weddings a night. Often, a drunken red priest named Ezzelyno performs the ceremony, or Eustace, who was once a septon before being defrocked. If neither are available, one of the mummers from the ship performs the service. Her real husband was lost at sea when she was but a teenager, and she prays constantly for his return. The sun is going down by the time she leaves. She walks for awhile with Dareon, who is going to play at another inn. As they enter a small back alley, she kills him. She returns to Brusco's house with the empty barrow and Dareon's boots. It is one of the nights she is to serve at the temple, so she takes her leave. After she arrives, she bathes, changes, and gets some food from Umma before going to help the waif. At one point as they work, the waif slaps her for biting her lip while thinking like Arya Stark and asks who she is. Arya replies she is no one and angrily asks who the waif is. Surprisingly, she tells her story. She was the only child of a noble and his first wife. When the woman died, her father remarried when he was six. When the second wife had a child, she tried to poison the waif so her child would inherit. The poison did not kill her, but left her in her deformed state. Her father offered her and two-thirds of his wealth to the Many-Faced God, and the Faceless Men killed his wife. The Kindly Man comes and asks her what she learned. She tells him about Narbo being stabbed, the fight between Quence and Alaquo, and how she killed Dareon. The Kindly Man has the waif bring Arya some warm milk, which Arya drinks despite the burnt and bitter aftertaste. When she wakes up the next morning, she is blind.","Sam gives a funerary service for Maester Aemon aboard the Cinnamon Wind somewhere off the coast of Dorne. Gilly is there, as is the crew, including the captain, Quhuru Mo, his daughter, Kojja, who translates Sam's words, and the mate, Xhondo. Sam breaks down at the end of his speech, and a cask of rum is brought out so the crew may celebrate the recently departed. For a while, it had seemed Aemon may recover. When Sam had returned to their room in Braavos with what Xhondo told him about the dragons, Maester Aemon returned to his old self for a time. He said that the prophecies had misled them all. They were looking for a prince, but as Barth had reasoned long ago, dragons are neither male nor female, so the gender is unimportant. Aemon always believed Rhaegar was the one, with the smoke of the prophecy being the fire that devoured Summerhall and the salt representing the tears for those lost. Rhaegar agreed with him at first, but later thought it must be his son Aegon, as a comet was seen above King's Landing the night Aegon was conceived, and Rhaegar was certain that the bleeding star had to be a comet. The dragons prove that it must be Daenerys.
Aemon was so determined to reach Daenerys that he actually walked onto the deck of the Cinnamon Wind under his own strength. Passage had cost them nearly everything they had left. Sam gave his sword to Xhondo as restitution for his ruined cloak, and the old books bound for the Citadel served as payment for their passage. Quhuru means to still give them to the Citadel, but for a price. He had also wanted Aemon's chain, but he was finally convinced to leave it be. All Sam has left are his clothes, boots, and the broken horn Jon found near the Fist of the First Men. When the ship reached Pentos, Maester Aemon was still strong and came up on deck to have Sam describe the city to him, but by the time they reached Tyrosh, his wits and strength were failing again. He began to implore Sam to make the maesters understand the great danger that is coming from the North and to tell them of Daenerys. Melisandre has misread the signs. He had hoped it could be Stannis, as his father's mother was Aegon V's daughter, Rhaelle, but the Lightbringer Stannis carries is a sure forgery. He tells Sam they must send Daenerys a maester so she can be counseled and protected. He becomes delirious soon after and begins to rave more and more. He speaks of dreams, but never names the dreamer,1 of a glass candle that cannot be lit,2 and of eggs that would not hatch3 He also says that the sphinx was the riddle, not the riddler, and asks Sam to read him passages from the writings of Septon Barth, whose works had been ordered burned by Baelor I. One day, he wakes up weeping, saying that the dragon must have three heads but he is too weak. By the time they reached the Stepstones, Aemon could barely remember Sam's name.
Sam laments to Gilly that Aemon might have lived another ten years on the Wall, but Gilly points out that Melisandre would have burned him. Gilly wants to name the baby Maester when he is two, but Sam says that is not a name and he should be called Aemon. Gilly agrees. Sam asks where the baby is, and Gilly says Kojja has her. The baby has become the darling of the female crew members, and Gilly has grown to trust and admire Kojja. The rum lowers Gilly's inhibitions, and she tells Sam she likes him. They grow drunk on the rum, go below decks, and have sex. Sam wakes up the next morning with a hangover to the sound of Xhondo exhorting him to work; the books had not been enough to pay the whole passage, so Sam and Gilly have been working for their passage. He avoids Gilly all day, ashamed of breaking his vow. In the end, Xhondo corners him and brings him to Kojja. She tells Sam that he can go to Gilly or walk to Oldtown. He protests that he took a vow, and Kojja tells him that Gilly knows this. She has lost everything she has known, and only wants Sam for a little while. Sam does go to her then and tells her they cannot be together. Gilly tells him that the trees watch over them, but right now, they are surrounded only by water.","Cersei has an audience with Aurane, freshly arrived on the evening tide on Sweet Cersei. He reports that Dragonstone has fallen. Cersei is pleased and releases Lord Paxter to return to the Arbor. The ironmen have been raiding up and down the Mander and overwhelmed the dozen or so ships Lord Paxter left at the Arbor. They have even made moves towards Oldtown. The battle at Dragonstone was a bloodbath, however, with a thousand dead, most of them on the Lannister side. Ser Loras is seriously wounded and expected to die. Cersei has Dorcas bring refreshments as Aurane tells her the whole tale. Cersei, pleased with this turn of events, goes to tell Margaery herself. Margaery is with her cousins, Alla, Megga, and Elinor, when Cersei arrives. She tells how Lord Paxter had been digging a tunnel under the walls, but Loras found the progress too slow and insisted on a frontal assault after the castellan, Rolland Storm, refused to settle the matter in single combat. Loras was the first through the breach, taking a quarrel through the thigh, another through the shoulder, and a mace blow that broke several ribs. Finally, as Loras led the assault on the inner wall, he was doused with boiling oil. Margaery, grief stricken, throws Cersei out.
That night, as Jocelyn lays beside her in bed in place of Taena, who did not come as usual, Cersei thinks of how pleased her father would be by what she has accomplished. Taena comes the next morning, telling Cersei that she was up all night with Margaery and her ladies talking about Loras. Margaery remains convinced that he will not die and she plans to send her own maester to tend to him. Ser Osmund enters to report that four have come claiming to have information about Tyrion, one of them with a head. The man with the head is Tyroshi, but when he opens the box bearing the head, Cersei sees right away that it is a fake. Furious, she orders Ser Meryn to take him to Qyburn. The other three informers have no good information either. With the audiences over, Cersei goes to court accompanied by Taena. Jalabhar Xho is the first to petition, asking as he always does for men to regain the Red Flower Vale. Cersei denies him and says maybe next year they can help, just as Robert always did. Lord Hallyne comes next, asking leave to hatch any dragon eggs found on Dragonstone. Cersei puts him off, as every attempt to hatch such eggs has ended in death, disaster, or disgrace. Next a group of merchants come forward, complaining that the Iron Bank is demanding repayment of all outstanding loans and refusing to issue new ones. Cersei is fed up with the bank and thinks she must start her own, but for now, all she can do is tell the merchants to pay up. Next a delegation from the Faith attends, Septon Raynard escorted by six members of the Warrior's Sons, including Lancel. Qyburn has reported that over a hundred knights have already joined the reconstituted Warrior's Sons. Although most of them are former household knights and hedge knights, Lancel is not the only man of higher station to pledge himself to the Faith. Cersei is angry, as she had summoned the High Septon himself, but Raynard says he is busy. Cersei summoned him because he and his followers are preaching against the brothels, and the owners have complained. Cersei orders the High Septon to halt this practice at once. Pycelle comes next, in place of Lord Gyles, who is too ill to leave his bed. Pycelle reports that Gyles is coughing up bits of lung now, and it will not be long before he dies. Cersei says that he has never died from his cough before, and she thinks someone is trying to kill him.
When court finally ends, Cersei has dinner with Tommen. She tells him to be thankful he is still a boy and does not have to attend court, for it is tedious work. Tommen says that Margaery believes he should attend court, but Cersei will not hear of it. She threatens to remove Margaery's tongue, and Tommen gets angry, reminds her that he is the king, and forbids it. Cersei summons Ser Boros from out in the hall and orders him to take Tommen to whip Pate. If Tommen refuses, Qyburn is to remove Pate's tongue. The night is dark, and Cersei finds herself thinking of Margaery, Loras, and the black cells. She had resolved not to give Falyse another thought, but cannot help it. Word has come from Castle Stokeworth that Lady Tanda is dead. Lollys is now the lady of the castle with Bronn as her lord. When she goes to sleep, Cersei dreams of the night she visited Maggy the Frog. Jeyne Farman and Melara Hetherspoon are there with her as they search the tourney grounds for the crone's tent. Maggy is sleeping when they enter, but Cersei wakes her up. As Maggy opens her eyes, Jeyne flees the tent. Maggy repeatedly tells them to leave, but Cersei refuses, and she finally agrees to tell their fortunes. Cersei asked if she would marry the prince, Rhaegar, and Maggy had replied she would marry the king. She also says that Cersei will be queen until another comes along, younger and more beautiful to cast her down and that she would have three children while her husband had sixteen. Her three children will wear golden crowns and golden shrouds, and once they are all dead, the valonqar will choke the life out of her. Cersei decides it is all lies and tries to lead Melara from the tent. However, Melara insists on asking if she will marry Jaime, who does not even know she is alive, and Maggy says her death is in the tent. Cersei throws some potion into Maggy's eyes, and the girls leave. That dream fades, and she dreams Tyrion is strangling her before waking with a start. Cersei wakes Dorcas and tells her to fetch Pycelle at once. She orders him to make her a potion that will let her sleep without dreaming. As he leaves, she asks if the future can be foretold. He says the Citadel has some old books that suggest it can be, but he says that even if it could, it should not be done. The next morning, Cersei has breakfast with a much subdued Tommen and then confers with Qyburn. She asks if Falyse is still alive and could be produced to challenge Bronn, but Qyburn informs the queen that while Falyse does live, she can no longer even feed herself. She next asks him if the future can be foretold, and tells her of the dream. Maggy foretold Melara's death, and then she drowned in a well. She also knew of Robert's bastards. Qyburn says that bloodmagic is powerful, but the prophecies need not come true. Cersei decides she must eliminate Margaery. Poison will raise too many questions, and none of her lovers are like to confess to bedding her, which would allow Cersei to execute her for treason. The next day, she approaches Osmund and asks him how good a sword Osney is and whether he could defeat Ser Boros. Osmund says that would be no problem. Cersei plans to have Osney confess to bedding Margaery.","Brienne, Podrick, Ser Hyle and Septon Meribald come across a corpse a mile from the crossroads. He is hanging from a tree and has salt shoved into his mouth. After that, they come across another corpse every hundred yards or so, each hanging from a tree and with salt in their mouths. They are men who took part in the raid on Saltpans. As the forest gives way to fields, the corpses hang from gibbets instead of trees. Brienne thinks she recognizes some from Harrenhal, but none has a hound's head helm. They are moving towards the Old Crossroads Inn. After Masha was hanged, one of her nephews had tried to reopen the inn but could not garner enough custom even after adding whores. He was later hanged. Now, two of Masha's nieces have apparently opened the inn once more. As they near the inn, they can hear hammering and see the glow from a forge. A large group of children greet them before the door; they are orphans. The oldest introduces herself as Willow and arranges accommodations for the night. A boy appears behind them, and Brienne thinks it must be Renly for a moment. Brienne asks Willow if the children are her kin, and she explains that the sparrows bring them and she and her sister Jeyne, the innkeep, look after them. Meribald asks if rooms are available. The boy, Gendry says no, but Willow says yes and orders some of the orphans, Wat, Will, Tansy, Pate, and Jon Penny, to see to their needs. When they are in their rooms, Brienne tells Podrick that she means to leave early the next morning while Ser Hyle is still sleeping.
Brienne and Podrick go down to the common room for dinner, which is crawling with children. Most of them are young, with the oldest being ten or twelve. Only Gendry approaches manhood. Ser Hyle approaches Brienne and tries to woo her to be his bride, but she rebuffs him. Meribald leads the assembled in a prayer before dinner, which Gendry does not join. After he stalks off, one of the orphans, Ben, tells them that Gendry worships the Lord of Light. Brienne takes some food out to Gendry at the forge. She questions him about his parentage, sure he must be King Robert's bastard, but the sound of new arrivals ends their conversation. Gendry says they are friends, but Brienne goes to the door and sees that there are seven riders, and Biter is one of them. Another wears Sandor's helm. Willow comes out to meet them with a loaded crossbow, and the man wearing the helmet threatens her. Brienne shows her self to save Willow. One of the men says they just want horses and will leave, but the man wearing the helmet wants to punish Brienne. He is Rorge. Brienne insults him, causing him to charge in a rage. After a short fight, Brienne kills Rorge with Oathkeeper. As she steps away, Biter slams into her, knocking her to the ground. He knocks her senseless and begins eating her as the other outlaws began fighting another enemy in the background.","Jaime meets with Ser Brynden before Riverrun. The Blackfish is rude and insulting from the beginning. Jaime offers to exchange Edmure for Lady Sybell and her children, but Brynden refuses. He also offers to let Brynden take the black and spare the garrison if Riverrun surrenders, but the Blackfish refuses this offer also. He continues to be rude and says that he only came out to see Jaime's stump before heading back to the castle. Jaime returns to camp, where Lew and Josmyn help him dismount, and he tells Ser Daven to gather a council of war. The council consists of Lord Clement, Lord Karyl, Lord Norbert, Ser Daven, Ser Lyle, Ser Addam, Ser Forley, Lord Emmon, Lady Genna, Ser Walder Rivers, and Edwyn, subbing for his drunk father. Ser Ilyn is present as well. The westerners all believe an assault is necessary, while the Riverlords want to stall as long as possible. Edwyn wants to make an assassination attempt on Brynden, an idea that has no support. Lord Clement insults Edwyn, and they almost come to blows before Jaime intercedes. Lord Clement storms off, and Jaime brings the meeting to a close saying that the assault will begin at first light. Ser Emmon comes up to Jaime to protest an assault that may damage the walls, while Lady Genna asks what he means to do about Edmure. Jaime decides to take Ser Lyle and Ser Ilyn and visit Edmure on his gallows. When Edmure sees Ser Ilyn, he tells Jaime to get it over with, and Jaime obliges. Edwyn comes running up followed shortly by Ser Ryman in an attempt to stop him. Ryman tries to explain that the threat of hanging Edmure should make the castle yield. Black Walder did the same thing at Seagard with Patrek Mallister with success. Jaime tells him that the threat is meaningless since he did not actually hang Edmure, cows him with a blow, and tells him to get out of the camp. Edmure is face down on the ground; Ilyn merely cut the rope on the gallows. Jaime sees a singer from Ser Ryman's camp and orders him to come with him and Edmure.1 They return to Jaime's tent, where Jaime sets Lew, Pia, and Josmyn to seeing to Edmure's needs. Jaime tells Edmure that he is going back to Riverrun. If he yields the castle, the garrison will be spared and any who wish to join the Night's Watch will be allowed to. If he does not, the castle will be sacked and burned, and Jaime will kill Edmure's child as soon as Roslin gives birth. Jaime tells the singer1 to play ""Rains of Castamere"" to drive his point home.","Cersei speaks to Grand Maester Pycelle with Taena and Ser Osmund in attendence. Lord Gyles has finally succumbed to his cough, and Cersei is not at all pleased. He has been attending Margaery often as late to give her sleeping draughts to help her as she grieves for Loras, and Cersei accuses Pycelle of killing Gyles on her order. She presses him, revealing that she knows he has been going to Margaery for some time before Loras was injured and threatens him with the black cells. He confesses that he provides her with moon tea, a contraceptive. As Lord Gyles had no children, Cersei declares that his lands and castles will escheat to the crown, despite the existence of a ward, and dismisses Pycelle. Cersei feels she can move against Margaery now, but she requires more proof to forestall Lord Mace. Margaery always has her ladies about her, and not one of Cersei's informants has seen her with a man. She decides Margaery's cousins must be apart of it and formulates a plan. Cersei tells Taena that she will sup with her and Lord Orton that night and that Taena should bring a singer for entertainment. At dinner, she tells Orton that she means to make Ser Harys the new master of coin and elevate him to the position of Hand. She then turns to the singer, Wat, the Blue Bard, and tells him that he deserves a reward as well. She accuses him of having seduced Margaery and orders her taken to the black cells. He denies the charge repeatedly, until Qyburn begins to torture him. In the end, he gives his whole life story, how he was the son of a chandler but ran off at twelve to join a troupe of singers wandering the Reach before coming to King's Landing, but does not confess to being a part of or witnessing any crime. By morning, the singer is completely broken. He gives names of men that made love to her, Ser Tallad, Ser Lambert, Jalabhar Xho, Ser Horas, Ser Hobber, Ser Osney, Hugh Clifton, and Ser Loras. Cersei makes him recant the accusations against Horas, Hobber, and Loras, as they are too valuable to harm, and tells him that he will have to testify about the others at trial and then will be allowed to join the Night's Watch. Cersei returns to her quarters, feeling slightly ill about what she had to do to the singer. Lady Taena is there and suggests a bath. Dorcas and Jocelyn prepare the bath, which Taena and Cersei share. Cersei wants to spare Tommen as much as she can and hates to move against all of Margaery's cousins since he is close to them, and Taena suggests that Alla should be declared innocent and persuaded to bear witness against the others. They go to bed, and Cersei has a dream of Tyrion torturing her. When she awakes, she tells Taena all about Maggy's prophecy. Tyrion is going to kill her, for valonqar means little brother. She takes breakfast with Tommen, who insists Loras will return. She asks if he will spend the day with Margaery, but he reminds her that they must fast and prepare for Maiden's Day, a holy day to the Faith. This gives Cersei an idea, and she meets with Osney. She tells him of her plan to implicate Margaery and tells him he must confess to the High Septon himself. Osney demands to have sex with her first, and she gives in.","Arianne is a prisoner in a tower at Sunspear. She believes she may be marked for a traitor's death and is resolved not to let that happen. On the way back to Sunspear, she had tried to apologize to Areo, who was angry over the escape of Ser Gerold, but he would not hear of it. Upon arrival at Sunspear, she was given into the care of Ricasso and Ser Manfrey and confined to the Spear Tower. Her co-conspirators, Garin, Andrey, and Sylva, were taken first to Planky Town and then to Ghaston Grey, where they will stay until their fates are decided. Arianne is lost in grief, both for the death of Arys and for the harm caused to Myrcella. Arianne wonders who could have betrayed her plan, but trusts Garin, Drey, and Sylva completely and does not believe it was Gerold since he turned his sword on Myrcella. That leaves Ser Arys. Arianne wonders if his guilt over betraying Myrcella had led him to betray Arianne and then throw away his life, but is not sure. Arianne expects that Prince Doran will come to see her soon, but days pass with no visit from her father. Her only company is the servants who take care of her needs but are not permitted to speak to her: Bors, Timoth, Morra, Mellei, Cedra, and Belandra. She continually tries to ask them for news, but she is rebuffed. She is particularly concerned about Myrcella, as the last time she saw the girl she was too weak to sit a horse and had her head wrapped in bandages from the wound given to her by Ser Gerold. After a fortnight passes without any sign of her father, Arianne tries to start subverting Cedra with small talk. She is infatuated with Garin, who bedded her once, and Arianne uses that to her advantage. After two days of painting a dire picture of Garin's fate for the girl, Cedra finally breaks and agrees to carry a message for her. She decides to send the letter to Lord Franklyn Fowler, and gives it to Cedra after several days of careful composing. After Cedra takes the message, she does not appear again. More days go by, until Arianne is weak and seldom rises from her bed anymore. Finally, Areo comes to summon her to Doran. Arianne asks what happened to Cedra, and Areo says she was sent to the Water Gardens. She is taken to Doran's solar, and Doran dismisses Areo. He is disappointed with Arianne and is in obvious pain. He tells her that Ser Gerold remains at large and that Myrcella still lives, though she is disfigured and missing her right ear. Her horse apparently shied away at the last second, or she would have died. Doran tells her that she could have never won a war against the Iron Throne and that her plan was futile from the start. Arianne tries to provoke Doran without success and asks for mercy for her friends. Doran has already decided not to kill them. Ser Andrey has been sent to Norvos to attend the Lady Mellario for three years, Garin has been sent to Tyrosh, and Sylva was forced to wed Lord Eldon Estermont. Doran says that Arianne may still get the war she wanted. Ser Balon is on his way with Gregor's head. He is being delayed at every castle along the way with feasts and games, but he will arrive eventually and want to see Myrcella. Arianne suggests telling him that Gerold tried to kill her and Arys gave his life in her defense, but Doran says that will not work once he speaks to Myrcella, and she cannot be silenced because Cersei will go to war if her daughter dies. Arianne realizes Doran needs her to convince Myrcella to lie. Arianne demands her rights as the heir to Dorne and tells Doran she knows he has been trying to rid himself of her. She brings up Quentyn and how he is in the Free Cities hiring swords to displace her. She asks why he hated her and tried to pawn her off on old men like Ben Beesbury, Eldon Estermont, Greybeard Grandison, Gyles Rosby, and Walder Frey. Doran explains that he had to make a show of finding her a husband to throw off suspicion, but that she had already long been promised to another. That plan when awry when her would-be husband was killed with molten gold.1 Now Quentyn heads east with Cletus Yronwood, Maester Kedry and three of Yronwood's best young knights2 to an uncertain welcome to bring back all that Dorne desires: justice, vengeance, fire and blood.","Sansa enters Robert's room. Robert threw his chamber pot at Maester Colemon when the maester tried to get him out of bed, which sent him running to Lothor, who went to Sansa in the hopes of getting him out of bed without resorting to force. Robert refuses to budge for Sansa either and wants him to read to him about Ser Artys Arryn, the semi-legendary first Arryn king of the Vale whom drove the First Men out and flew to the top of the Giant's Lance on a giant falcon to slay the Griffin King. Sansa continues to try to get him out of bed with bribes and flattery. They are going down the mountain to the Gates of the Moon, for winter has come to the mountaintop and the Eyrie will soon be inaccessible. She finally cajoles him into going and steps into the next room, where Maddy, Gretchel, Maester Colemon and Robert's squires, Terrance Lynderly and Gyles Grafton await. She sets them to preparing Robert for the descent. She mentions to the maester that Robert complained of something bitter in his milk the night before, and the maester asks if he is bleeding from the nose, which he is not. The maester thinks that they should just give him milk of the poppy and have him make the descent in his sleep, but the full extent of his frailty must not become common knowledge. She wishes Petyr was there, but he is in Gulltown attending the wedding of Lord Lyonel to a merchant's daughter, a match he arranged himself. Lord Gerold Grafton, Lord Jon Lynderly, and Ser Edmund Waxley will be there as well, and so will Lord Benedar Belmore, who has reconciled with Petyr. She orders the maester to keep him calm as best he can, but the maester complains that the fits are getting worse. She tells him to use more sweetsleep, which he agrees to do reluctantly and which he says should not be done again for half a year or more for Robert's health.
Sansa goes to find Ser Lothor, who is in the winch room with Mord and a couple of others preparing supplies, and tells him that Robert is out of bed and getting ready. Lothor tells her that Myranda Royce made the ascent with the mule handler, Mya Stone, which worries Sansa since Petyr warned her that she is shrewd and dangerous. She goes to pack the last of her things, and when she returns, Mya has joined Lothor and Mord, waiting impatiently for Robert to arrive. Sansa and Robert descend to Sky in the bucket, where Myranda greets them. The others soon follow. Mya will go first with Lord Robert, while the other two mule handlers, Ossy and Carrot, will follow at staggered intervals. On the way down, Myranda tells Sansa that Petyr sent a letter. The wedding was a great success, and Lady Anya and Ser Symond made surprise appearances, meaning the Lords Delcarant are down to three. Petyr is on his way back to the Gates. Sansa asks if there is any other news, and Myranda tells her they have learned that Riverrun yielded, but Storm's End and Dragonstone still hold out.1 She also mentions that a bastard son of Lord Eddard now commands the Night's Watch, and Sansa blurts out Jon's name in surprise without thinking. Lord Yohn held a small melee at Runestone for squires to showcase Harrold Hardyng, Harold the Heir, whom Lord Yohn knighted afterwards. They come to a narrow point on the path, and Sansa has to dismount and walk across with Robert, who is shaking with fear. By the time they pass Stone, it has begun to snow, but they dare not stop or the snow could be five feet deep. When they arrive at the Gates, a guard tells Sansa that Petyr has returned and will see her immediately. When she arrives, he is just finishing with three hedge knights just taken into his service, Ser Byron, Ser Morgarth, and Ser Shadrich. When they leave, Petyr gives Sansa a deep kiss on the lips and tells her that he has made her a marriage contract. She is now promised to Harold Hardyng. Lady Anya is heavily in debt, and Petyr used that fact to his advantage to offer her a truly gigantic dowry for the betrothal. The only condition is that she will not make him marry against his will and Sansa must win his favor. Sansa is confused why he is called Harry the Heir if Lady Anya has sons of her own, and Petyr explains. Lord Jon's father, Jasper, had two sons and a daughter. In addition to Jon, there was Alys, who married Ser Elys Waynwood, uncle to Lady Anya, and Ronnel, who had a single son, Elbert, before dying of a bad belly. Elbert was later killed by Aerys II.2 Alys gave birth to eight daughters and a son, Jasper. Jasper died at three when he was kicked in the head by a horse, and two of the girls died of a pox. The eldest daughter married Ser Denys Arryn, a member of one of the numerous minor branches of the house, but he died during Robert's Rebellion, and his wife and infant son were dead soon after. Of the other Waynwood girls, one was left disfigured the same pox that killed her sisters and became a septa, another was seduced by a sellsword and cast out by Ser Elys, joining the silent sisters after her bastard died in infancy, a third wed the Lord of the Paps, but was barren, the fourth was carried off by Burned Men while on her way to marry a Bracken, and the fifth was married off to a knight sworn to the Waynwoods and gave birth to Harrold before she died. Harrold, therefore, is heir to the Vale. Petyr says that it is only a matter of time before sickly Robert dies and Harrold becomes Lord of the Vale. At that time, he will marry Sansa Stark, and every knight in the Vale will rally to her to reclaim Winterfell.","Brienne, feverish and semi-conscious, tries to make sense of what is going on around her. She has been bound at the wrists and ankles and thrown over a horse. She can hear Podrick calling out to her, but does not have the strength to respond. She has horrible nightmares that mingle with what is actually going on around her. She hears a girl say that Brienne will die soon if they keep going, and another refers to her as a ""lion."" She also hears a prayer, but the words are strange, referring to the night being dark and full of terrors. They stop after awhile, and a girl gives her something strong and sour to help with the pain. She only drinks a little at first, but the girl tells her to drink more, as she has a broken arm and two or three cracked ribs. She suddenly remembers her fight with Biter and goes into a panic until the girl assures her that Gendry killed him by shoving a spearpoint through the back of his neck. Brienne focuses on the girl and realizes from her looks that she must by Jeyne Heddle, the innkeep. Brienne asks to be released, but Jeyne informs her that she is to be bound until she is brought before the lady. Brienne realizes she is being taken to Lady Stoneheart. She drifts off into a delirious sleep once more, waking again when Jeyne gives her some broth. She asks to see Gendry, but he has returned to the inn. She notices that one of her captors wears a sodden yellow cloak and is wearing Sandor's helm.1 He tells Brienne that she is to be hanged. Another man talks to her as well; he only has one eye.2 As they continue to ride again, a hood is pulled over her head and she goes back to her dreams.
When Brienne wakes again, she is laying on a pallet in a cave clad only in a linen shirt. Her injuries have been seen to. An old man in the remains of a pink and white robe stirs beside her and asks if she needs anything. He tells her that her fever has broken and that it was Jeyne who tended her wounds. She asks why they would tend her wounds if they meant to hang her, and he answers that she fought bravely at the crossroads. Lem was supposed to stay close to the inn, but he was drawn away by a ruse instigated by Rorge and his companions. Brienne saved everyone at the inn and earned her wounds there honorably. Brienne asks the man who he is, and he replies that he and his fellows are kingsmen without a king and a brotherhood that has been broken. He knows not where they are going now, but knows the road is dark. Brienne realizes the man is Thoros, which he confirms. He also says that Lord Beric's fire has gone out of the world. Thoros brings her food and tells her what has become of her companions. Meribald was sent on his way, but Podrick and Ser Hyle are also awaiting judgment. Brienne asks for mercy for Podrick since he is only a boy, but Thoros tells her that the cave holds no mercy. She asks of justice, and he responds that they did justice when Lord Beric was alive, but now things are different.
Four men, including Lem and the one-eyed man2 come for her at that point to take her to Lady Stoneheart. She is taken to a large chamber full of people. The only person she recognizes is Jeyne. In one corner, a woman clad in grey and hooded holds a crown and studies it.3 The outlaws accuse her of serving the Lannisters, and when she tries to explain her quest to look for Sansa, they assume it was to put her in a Lannister dungeon. Podrick and Hyle are brought in at that point as well. Hyle has been badly beaten. Brienne says they had no part in anything she might have done and implores the outlaws to let them go, but the fact that they serve the Lannisters is all the excuse the outlaws need to hang them. Lady Stoneheart examines the parchment and the sword and then grabs her throat and speaks in a halting and broken voice that Brienne cannot understand. A young northman4 interprets for Stoneheart. She asks what name Brienne's sword has, and Brienne tells her it is Oathkeeper. Stoneheart gives a hiss and says it should be oathbreaker instead since Brienne has betrayed her. Brienne realizes that Stoneheart is Catelyn. Catelyn lowers her hood to show her face, which is terrible to look upon. Thoros explains that she was killed by the Freys and discovered by the outlaws.5 Harwin begged Thoros to raise her, but he would not, as it had been too long. Beric did the deed himself, and passed the flame of his life on to her. Beric died and Catelyn rose. Brienne swears she is still faithful, but Catelyn will not believe her without a test of faith. She wants all those who killed her son dead. The outlaws will do for the Freys and Boltons, but she wants Brienne to kill Jaime.6 Brienne protests that Jaime has truly changed and could not have participated in the Red Wedding, but Catelyn says she must choose between slaying Jaime or hanging. Brienne refuses to choose, and Catelyn orders her, Hyle, and Podrick hanged. They are taken outside, and as Brienne begins to choke and watches Podrick dying beside her, she musters her last strength to scream one word.","Cersei receives a delegation of the Faith led by a Septa Moelle in the throne room. The Faith has seized Margaery, Megga, Alla, and Elinor. Lord Orton asks what they stand accused of, and the septa explains that Margaery stands accused of adultery and high treason, Megga and Elinor are accused of lewdness, fornication, and conspiracy to commit treason, and Alla is charged with witnessing these acts. All is going as Cersei has planned, but she must feign ignorance for the benefit of those assembled. She asks how this is known, and the septa reveals that Ser Osney confessed, shocking Ser Harys Grand Maester Pycelle and many of those assembled, some of which exit the room. Cersei has ordered Ser Osfryd to make sure his goldcloaks take note of who leaves. The septa also reveals that Margaery's maidenhead is not intact; she was examined by Moelle and two other septas, Aglantine and Melicent, as well as Nysterica, who has been confined to a penitent's cell. Megga and Elinor have both been examined and found not to be maidens as well. Cersei demands that her own maesters be allowed to examine the girls, and bids Pycelle to do so. Pycelle, playing his part in the plan, says there is no need for him to do so, as he has provided moon tea to Margaery many times. The throne room erupts at the news; even Moon Boy is struck speechless with shock. Cersei leads the small council out, flanked by Ser Boros, Ser Meryn and Ser Osmund. Ser Harys fears a riot when the smallfolk learn what has happened, and Aurane recommends launching the dromonds to protect the city, which Cersei agrees should be done. Ser Harys is deathly afraid that Lord Mace will assault the city to get Margaery back, but Cersei thinks he does not have the nerve. She says she will go see the High Septon and attempt to make peace with him and prepare a trial. Lord Orton says the High Septon may want to try her himself, as the Faith used to do, which Cersei is counting on since the Faith will not look kindly on adultery. Cersei next goes to Tommen, and has him sign ten blank arrest warrants before sending him off with Jocelyn. She then fills in the names herself and gives them to Osfryd to carry out. They are for Ser Tallad, Jalabhar Xho, Hamish, Hugh Clifton, Mark Mullendore, Bayard Norcross, Lambert Turnberry, Horas Redwyne, Hobber Redwyne, and Wat, the Blue Bard. She tells Osfryd not to harm them, as some may be innocent. She means to have Horas and Hobber be found not guilty to make the judgment of the others seem fairer. Osfryd reports that a small crowd, about a hundred, have gathered in front of the Great Sept demanding Margaery's release. Cersei says they should be left alone.
By the end of the next day, all ten are in custody. Tallad resisted and wounded three goldcloaks before succumbing, and Hamish collapsed when they came for him. All are sent to the dungeon save Horas and Hobber, who are given comfortable apartments. Qyburn reports that Hamish is having difficulty breathing and wants a maester, and Cersei replies that he can have one when he confesses. She decides he was too old to have taken part himself and should confess that he witnessed the others. The next day, Lady Taena accompanies her to see Margaery at the Great Sept. Cersei orders Taena to visit the cousins and try to win over Alla while she is with Margaery. They are guarded by ten men led by Ser Boros. Taena asks what happens if Margaery demands trial by battle, and Cersei tells her that the honor of a queen may only be defended by the Kingsguard. Since Loras is gravely wounded, Arys, Balon, and Jaime are elsewhere, and Osmund is brother to her accuser, that leaves only Ser Meryn and Ser Boros, neither of which are competent swordsmen. When they arrive, three Warrior's Sons led by Ser Theodan Wells meet her to escort her to the High Septon. He is praying when they arrive, and makes them wait until he is finished. Cersei asks to see Margaery and is given leave to do so. She finds Margaery in a small cell clad only in a roughspun shift. She tells Cersei that she has no visitors but a group of septas, including one named Unella, who come every hour to ask if she is ready to confess. Cersei tells her there will be a trial, and Margaery seems afraid. Cersei tells her that she may have a trial by combat with either Meryn or Boros as her champion, and Margaery realizes she has been set up and angrily tells Cersei to leave. Cersei converses with the High Septon again. She says there should be a trial conducted by the Faith. This pleases the High Septon, as the Faith has been forbidden to sit in judgment since the days of Jaehaerys I. He says there will be seven judges, three of them women, to represent the seven faces of god. He also agrees with Cersei that any trial by combat must involve the Kingsguard. Cersei says she must return to the castle with Ser Osney so the small council can question him, but the High Septon will not let her leave with him. Instead, he takes her to him. He is hanging from chains in a dark cell and has been tortured. The High Septon explains that while he came willingly, he seemed to pleased at being guilty. Under the torture, he not only admitted that he did not touch Margaery and in fact had sex with Cersei, he also admitted to killing the previous High Septon on Cersei's orders, smothering him with a pillow. Cersei turns and runs, but she is stopped by a group of septas. She is taken to a cell and held down while a Septa Scolera strips her and leaves her a roughspun shift. Cersei threatens them all, but the women are not cowed. She is left alone and soon falls asleep. She is awakened by the arrival of Septa Unella, who asks her to confess. When Cersei refuses, Unella says she will be back in an hour. She has no visitors over the next day or so save Unella with her demands for confession and Moelle, who brings her food. Finally, Qyburn arrives. He tells her that she is to be tried for murder, treason, and fornication. Osfryd is no longer in command of the goldcloaks, having been removed by royal decree and replaced by the captain of the Dragon Gate, Humfrey Waters. Ser Harys and Grand Maester Pycelle rule the realm now, and they have written to Ser Kevan inviting him to become Hand. Qyburn no longer sits on the small council, and Lord Orton has resigned his seat and fled to his seat with Taena. Lord Mace has broken the siege of Storm's End and is marching for the city, and Lord Randyll is coming from Maidenpool as well. Lord Aurane fled as soon as Cersei's predicament became known, sailing away with all the dromonds. Cersei says she is lost, but Qyburn reminds her she has a champion no man can defeat.1 Cersei laughs at this, for she has already made it so a queen may only be defended by the Kingsguard. She orders Qyburn to send a letter to Jaime urging him to come right away to save her.","Ser Emmon angrily complains of treachery from Edmure to Jaime as Genna tries to calm him. Jaime is mad as well, for Brynden has escaped. Jaime asks Edmure where he is, but Edmure does not know. He acts defiant until a threat from Jaime cows him into saying that Brynden escaped by swimming through the Water Gate. The castle had yielded late the day before, and in all the confusion Jaime had not realized Brynden had escaped until the next morning. Jaime has Ser Addam and Ser Dermot hunting for him. Emmon is afraid that Brynden may try to retake the castle, but he has a garrison of two hundred, so Jaime does not think that likely. Genna drags Emmon out, and Jaime has the guards escort Edmure to his tower cell soon after. Edmure will be sent to Casterly Rock the next day with a strong escort led by Ser Forley. A guard comes to announce that Lady Sybell and Jeyne are outside as commanded. They are shown in. Jeyne's face is puffy from crying, and there is a scab on her head. Jaime asks where it came from, and Lady Sybell explains that she had to fight Jeyne to take her crown. Jeyne is furious because Robb had the crown made for her, and she truly loved him. Lady Sybell moves to slap her, but Jaime intercedes. He asks if Jeyne is with child, and Sybell replies that she made sure she did not get with child as Lord Tywin commanded. Jeyne flees from the room sobbing. Sybell also says that Tywin promised that her daughters would wed lords or heirs, which is far better than they would have done otherwise due to Lady Sybell's low ancestry. Jaime says the marriages will take place, though Jeyne must wait two years to wed so that any child of the marriage will not be thought to come from her marriage to Robb. Sybell also asks after her son Raynald. She did not know about the Red Wedding, or she would not have allowed him to go. He also had no knowledge of her understanding with Tywin. Jaime says that if he is still alive, he will see a ransom is paid. Jaime is disgusted with Lady Sybell and dismisses her with harsh words, telling her she will leave for the west with Forley and Edmure.
The next day, Jaime rides for awhile with Ser Forley and his escort of four hundred. Forley assures him that Edmure will be closely watched, and Jaime tells him to keep an eye on Jeyne as well. He rides past Lord Gawen and his family on the way back to Riverrun. Lord Gawen gives him a nod, but Sybell stares at him icily and Jeyne does not even see him. She has ripped her dress as a sign of mourning. Rather than going straight back to the castle, Jaime stops by the Frey camp to speak to Edwyn. He finds him with Ser Walder Rivers and is surprised to receive a hostile greeting from Edwyn. Ser Ryman is dead; he was hanged by outlaws along with his escort of three knights and a dozen men-at-arms. The outlaws apparently expected him, and Edwyn suspects it was arranged by Black Walder.1 Jaime tells Edwyn that Tommen requires all the prisoners taken at the Red Wedding. Jaime asks after Ser Raynald and discovers he is almost certainly dead. When Ser Whalen came for him and Grey Wind, Ser Raynald handed over his sword, but grabbed an axe when the Freys started peppering Grey Wind with arrows. He took a quarrel in the shoulder and another in the gut before throwing himself in the river. The next morning, the Freys have all left. Their siege equipment is still there. Ser Daven suggests taking it to Raventree to deal with Lord Tytos, but Jaime orders it burned, saying he has his own plan for dealing with Tytos. That night, Jaime fights with Ser Ilyn for three hours. He is getting better, but he still has little skill. Afterwards, they drink wine, and Jaime talks of Cersei. He thinks he should geld Ser Osmund for what he did, but has no idea what to do with his sister. Ser Ilyn suggests killing her, but he does not want to do that to Tommen.
The next day, Ser Dermot comes back to report no sign of Ser Brynden. He did have to contend with hundreds of wolves, however, that showed no fear of him and his men. They killed two sentries and his best bay. One of the sentries, Jate, told him before he died that they were led by a monstrous she-wolf. Jaime wonders if it could be the wolf that savaged Joffrey at the Trident.2 The next day, Ser Dermot rides out to continue the search and the Riverlords take their leave. Lord Clement asks after Marq, and Jaime assures him that all the captives at the Twins will be ransomed. Lord Karyl lingers to tell him that he must go to Raventree, as Tytos will never yield to Jonos, but he will yield to Jaime. Ser Lyle departs the next as well to return to Castle Darry and deal with outlaws as he promised. Jon Bettley goes with him. Jaime is pleased with the progress he has made in the Riverlands and decides to return to King's Landing when he has found Ser Brynden. He also decides he must get Tommen away from Cersei, replace the small council, and make sure Kevan becomes Hand. If Kevan will not come, he thinks he could offer the post to Ser Forley, Lord Roland, Lord Mathis, or even Petyr, since he is clever but has no strength of his own to make him a threat. The next day, Jaime turns loose the garrison of Riverrun after each man swears an oath not to take up arms against Lord Emmon or House Lannister. Ser Desmond and Ser Robin stay behind and ask leave to join the Night's Watch, which Jaime grants. He has a dozen of Gregor's men escort them led by Raff. Several days later, Ser Emmon assembles all his people in the yard to give a three hour speech of what he expected from them. Jaime notices the singer he took from Ryman among them and comes over to chat. They mock Ser Emmon, and Jaime asks why the singer did not leave. He says that with Whitesmile Wat gone with Ser Forley the castle has no singer and he thinks he might stay on for the winter. Jaime asks the singers name, and he replies it is Tom of Sevenstreams, before Jaime departs. That night, Jaime has a strange dream of a blond-haired woman dressed as a silent sister. She says Tywin had always dreamed that his son would be a great knight and his daughter a queen and that no one would laugh at them. When Jaime replies that his son is a knight and his daughter is a queen, a tear rolls down the woman's cheek and she walks away. He wakes shivering and sees that it is snowing; winter s almost there, and there will be no final harvest. The next morning, the snow is ankle deep. There is a knock at the door, and Josmyn answers it and shows in Maester Vyman. He has come with Qyburn's letter from Cersei telling Jaime to come defend her. Vyman asks if Jaime means to send an answer, and he replies that he would not and orders Josmyn to burn it.","Cinnamon Wind passes through the Redwyne Straits on the last leg of their voyage. The route is perilous, as the ironmen have taken advantage of the absence of the Redwyne fleet to sack Ryamsport and capture Vinetown and Starfish Harbor. They are now raiding shipping heading to Oldtown. Three times, they spot longships. The first two are sighted far astern and pose no threat, while the third is sent on its way by a single volley from Kojja and her archers. As they enter Whispering Sound, Sam points out Three Towers, the seat of House Costayne, to Gilly The sight makes Sam sad, for it means their journey is almost over. The sound is full of corpses and burned ships, including two large dromonds. Xhondo says a battle must have been fought there not long ago. The next day, a war galley from Oldtown named Huntress approaches with two smaller ships. The captain comes aboard to inspect the ship and its cargo. He apologizes and explains that a fortnight ago, a group of ironmen captured a Tyroshi ship, killed the crew, and planned to sail into Oldtown in disguise to set fires and open the gates to their fellows while the garrison was fighting the fires. Luckily, they came across the Lady of the Tower, which has an oarmaster with a Tyroshi wife. He hailed them in the Tyroshi tongue, and the ironmen were unable to answer. The ironmen hold many offshore islands, including Stonecrab Cay, the Isle of Pigs, the Mermaid's Palace, Horseshoe Rock, and Bastard's Cradle. Sam asks what Lord Leyton is doing, since he commands three times the numbers of any other Tyrell bannerman. The captain says that these numbers are useless without ships. Baelor is building new galleys, Gunthor is guarding the harbor, Garth is training new recruits, and Humfrey has gone to Lys to hire sellsails. Sam worries that even Horn Hill may not be safe despite being pretty far inland and wonders if he should keep Gilly in Oldtown or have Quhuru take her to the Summer Isles, but the former would require he desert the Night's Watch, and the latter would not keep her out of harm's way since the ship has to brave the straits again. He decides he must still send her on to Horn Hill.
The ship arrives at Oldtown on a cold damp morning. The harbor is protected by a boom linking two dozen hulks backed up by a line of galleys anchored by the Honor of Oldtown. Ser Gunthor Hightower comes aboard to personally inspect the ship. He knows the language of the Summer Islands thanks to several years of study at the Citadel, so he and Quhuru go to the captain's cabin for a private conference. While they converse, Sam explains to Gilly that he must go to the Citadel first to deliver Jon's letters and report Maester Aemon's death and that afterwards he will arrange for transportation for Gilly to Horn Hill. After the ship docks, Sam makes his way to the Seneschal's Court in the Citadel to deliver his messages. The acolyte on duty takes his name and tells him to wait until called for. He waits half the day as others that came after him are let in. He even dozes off for a time. Finally, a dark-skinned youth comes up to him and says he must give the acolyte, Lorcas, a penny or he will be waiting for days. Lorcas has been an acolyte for fifty years and hates both novices and those of noble birth. The youth introduces himself as Alleras and says he is oft called the Sphinx. Sam blurts out what Aemon told him about the sphinx being the riddle, not the riddler and asks Alleras if he knows what it means, but the youth does not. Alleras asks what business Sam has with Theobald, the seneschal, and Sam says Aemon told him the seneschal was Norren. Alleras explains that the Archmaesters takes turns at the post, switching every year, and that Norren was seneschal two years ago. Walgrave was supposed to serve this year, but due to his failing wits, Theobold stepped in instead. Alleras is surprised to hear of Maester Aemon and asks why he was at sea at his age. Sam decides to tell him about Stannis and Melisandre, followed by Mance and dragons and wights and others and everything else, ending by explaining how Daenerys is the only hope for Westeros. Alleras says that Theobold will not believe him and that he will take Sam to a different archmaester. They climb the steps of the Ravenry, and come across Leo Tyrell at the top, staring into a candle flame. He mocks Sam before Archmaester Marwyn summons Alleras and Sam into his chambers. In the middle of the room is a candle of dragonglass with a flame that does not flicker and casts an eerie light. Marwyn explains that the Valyrians used candles such as this one to scry over great distances. A novice is also in the room. Marwyn was using the candle to eavesdrop on Sam's conversation with Alleras in the Seneschal's Court, but he has Sam repeat the tale in case he missed something. When Sam finishes, Marwyn is unsure of what to think, as he does not trust prophecy. Alleras says that Aemon wanted to send her a maester, and Marwyn responds that it is good Aemon did not arrive, as the archmaesters might have killed him. Sam asks why, and Marwyn intimates that the Citadel was behind the death of the last dragons and that they have been actively trying to build a world bereft of magic. Marwyn decides he will go in Aemon's place, on the ship that brought Sam. Sam is to become a novice and forge a chain. Marwyn tells the novice to get him quarters, before heading straight for the docks. After he leaves, Alleras confesses that he did not meet Sam by chance and that Marwyn knew he was coming thanks to the glass candle. The novice secures quarters for Sam. Sam introduces himself to the novice, who gives his name as Pate.1"
